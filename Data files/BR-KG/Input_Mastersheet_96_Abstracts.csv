A blend of dolomite, limestone, and cullet was added to act as a reductant and a glass matrix former in vitrification. Specimens were vitrified using an electrical heating furnace at 1400Â°C and the output products included slag, ingot, flue gas, and fly ash. The major constituents of the slag were Ca, Mn, and Si, and the results of the toxicity leaching characteristics met the standards in Taiwan. The ingot was a good material for use in production of stainless steel, due to being mainly composed of Fe and Mn. For the fly ash, the high level of Zn makes it economical to recover. The distribution of metals indicated that most of Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Ni moved to the ingot, while Al, Ca, Mg, and Si stayed in the slag; Hg vaporized as gas phase into the flue gas; and Cd, Pb, and Zn were predominately in the fly ash.

In this study, electrolysis of copper sulfate to produce sulfuric acid and electrons were utilized to recover Li, Co, Ni and Mn from spent LIBs. The obtained results showed that 93 % of Ni, 91 % of Co, 89 % of Mn and 94 % of Li were leached and 99 % of Cu was deposited during leaching process by adopting the 0.225 mol/L of copper sulfate with a solid/liquid ratio of 15 g/L at a current density of 50 mA/m2 and 80 Â°C for 4.5 h. Then, a current efficiency of 72 % for the cathode and 30 % for the anode was achieved at a current density of 40 mA/m2, 70 Â°C and pH 2.5 during electrodeposition process. The Ni-Co deposition followed the principle of anomalous codeposition and the complete deposition time of Co, Ni and Mn were 3 h, 9 h and 10 h, respectively. Eventually, the Ni, Co, Mn, Li and Cu can be recovered as Ni-Co alloy, MnO2 and Li2CO3 and Cu metals with the corresponding recovery rates of 99.40 %, 91.00 %, 90.68 %, 85.59 % and 89.55 %, respectively.

In this paper, leaching with H2SO4+H2O2, P507 extraction, and sedimentation with oxalic acid and carbonic acid were used to deal with waste batteries and obtain cobalt and lithium salts by separation, which shows an easy and feasible method with less waste water disposal. The effects of sulphuric acid concentration, pH value, and lithium ions on the recovery were investigated. When the sulphuric acid concentration was over 0.4mol/L, the loss of cobalt increased significantly. If pH value of 3.5 was used, it was easy for cobalt and lithium separation with a low cobalt loss.

21,10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123156,Recycling lead from waste lead-acid batteries by the combination of low temperature alkaline and bath smelting,"Recycling lead from waste lead-acid batteries has substantial significance in environmental protection and economic growth. Bearing the merits of easy operation and large capacity, pyrometallurgy methods are mostly used for the regeneration of waste lead-acid battery (LABs). However, these processes are generally operated at the temperature higher than 1300 Â°C. To shorten the energy consumption, a novel pyrometallurgy process which consisted of low temperature alkaline and bath smelting was proposed in this work. The reduction of lead and smelting of slag system are the key factors determine the energy consumption. Thermodynamic calculation suggested that the addition of Na2CO3 can make the reduction of PbSO4 spontaneously at the temperature higher than 288 Â°C (PbSO4 â†’ PbCO3 â†’ PbO â†’ Pb), while direct reduction of PbSO4 necessitated the temperature higher than 1499 Â°C (PbSO4 â†’ PbO â†’ Pb). To achieve the efficient reduction of PbSO4, the molar ratios of C/PbSO4 and Na2CO3/PbSO4 should be higher than 0.5 and 1.0, respectively. Meanwhile, a new smelting system (i.e., FeO-SiO2-CaO-Na2O) was established in the presence of Na2CO3. Phases with low melting temperatures, such as NaFe2O3, Na2FeSiO4, Na2Ca2Si2O7, Na14Fe6O16 and Na0.5FeO2, were formed. The melting temperature of Fe-Si-Ca-Na system was lowered to 1050 Â°C at the mass dosage of Na2CO3 at 30%. Recovery of lead under various reduction conditions were systematically evaluated. Under optimum operational conditions, i.e., the dosages of C and Na2CO3 at 10% and m(actual)/m(theory) ratio of 1.3 (all in mass), smelting temperature of 1050 Â°C, and smelting time of 75 min, respectively, the lead recovery efficiency reached >98.0%. Moreover, this method has been successfully applied for the industrial recovery of lead at the scale of 200, 000 tons annually since 2019. Taken together, this method is robust for recovery of lead from the waste LABs and is helpful for building the resource-conserving society.",Lead Acid Battery,low temperature alkaline and bath smelting,"1050 °C, smelting time: 75 min ",lead,1050,Lead (Pb),98,recovery efficiency,Pb,98%,,,,,,,,,4,160494.6

Li+ was selectively leached from cathode materials in a system of NaHSO4 and H2O2. Under the optimal conditions of leaching temperature of 65 Â°C, 1.1 times molar quantity NaHSO4, 2 vol% H2O2, solid-liquid ratio of 100 g/L and leaching time of 15 min, the leaching efficiency of Li can reach 99.84%, while Fe is only 0.048%. Meanwhile, XRD, FTIR, XPS and TEM analysis were carried out to explore the conversion mechanism in the oxidation leaching process of the original raw and leaching products. Li+ in the filtrate was precipitated with Na2CO3 and converted into Li2CO3. The precipitated salty wastewater can be converted into leaching agent for recycling by adding a certain amount of sulfuric acid.

Soaring demands for lithium in cathode materials of rechargeable batteries result in a surge in waste saggar after being used in the calcination of cathode precursor. The recycling of lithium from waste saggar is therefore imperative due to the high supply-risk of lithium. Herein, waste saggar composed of various mineral phases (26.26 % LiAlSi4O10 â‰… 0.6 % Li; 6.34 % Li4SiO4 â‰… 1.47 % Li; 0.79 % LiOHâˆ™H2O â‰… 0.13 % Li; 0.03 % Li2CO3 â‰… 0.01 % Li) was leached in water for lithium extraction; while the effects of NaOH, Ca(OH)2, and H2SO4 as potential additives were examined under a wide temperature range of 5â€“80 Â°C. Interestingly, the observed order of leaching efficiency at lower temperature (20 Â°C) H2SO4 > NaOH > Ca(OH)2 was in variance with that at 80 Â°C (NaOH > H2SO4 Ca(OH)2). The apparent activation energy for lithium extraction was determined to be 29.8 kJ/mol using NaOH, 33.8 kJ/mol using Ca(OH)2, and 14.1 kJ/mol using H2SO4, indicating that the overall leaching process follows a mixed-controlled mechanism.

164,10.1016/j.jece.2024.114091,Selective leaching of lithium from mixed spent lithium iron phosphate powder,"In recent years, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries have been widely used in the electric vehicle industry. The recycling of spent LFP will be propitious to conserving resources and alleviating the environmental risks it poses. In this study, a selective extraction method for lithium from spent LFP was proposed using nitric acid. Lithium leached into the liquid phase, while P and Fe remained in the leaching residue. Under the conditions of 120Â°C, HNO3/Li molar ratio of 2, and time of 2â€¯h, the leaching efficiency of lithium reached 99.5â€¯%, with a selectivity reaching 82.1â€¯%. Initially, LFP was decomposed to liberate Li, Fe, and P in the liquid phase. Subsequently, ferrous ions were oxidized to trivalent, high-valent iron ions re-precipitated as FePO4Â·2â€¯H2O. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that the temperature and pH value of the extraction system have significant influence on both the oxidation and reprecipitation steps. An imbalance of Fe/P ratio (<1) in the raw material hinders the selectivity of lithium extraction, and supplementing this portion of Fe can enhance the selectivity to over 90â€¯%. Additionally, LiCO3 and anhydrous FePO4 were effectively regenerated from the leachate and residue.

This study presents a selective leaching treatment for removing impurities from LES, and then the battery-grade FePO4 is recovered. The leaching efficiency of impurity elements such as Ni, Cu, and Mn can reach up to 99.53%, 98.08%, and 97.65%, respectively, while the main element of Fe and P remain as low as 0.3% and 1.6%, and recovered FePO4 (R-FePO4) conformed to China Chemical Industry Standard for battery-grade FePO4 (HG/T 4701â€“2014). The leaching experiment shows that H3PO4 treatment contributes to obtaining excellent crystalline FePO4, while the addition of HCl mainly enhanced the leaching performance of metal impurities. The optimal conditions for recovering battery-grade FePO4 were: 1.5 mol/L H3PO4, H3PO4/HCl molar ratio of 3:1, a liquidâ€“solid ratio of 10 mL/g, leaching at 90 Â°C for 3 h. The thermodynamics of the leaching reactions was analyzed to determine the feasibility of leaching impurities and crystallizing FePO4 from LES. The composition and structure of the regenerated FePO4 were restored, and the electrochemical performance reached the same level as commercial materials. In addition, the cost of R-FePO4 is calculated to be $1.35 kgâˆ’1, which is about 32.5% lower than the cost of commercial FePO4 (C-FePO4, $2.0 kgâˆ’1).

144,10.1016/j.susmat.2024.e01043,Synergetic recycling of permanent magnet and Li-ion battery cathode material for metals recovery,"Rare earth elements (REEs)-based (NdFeB) magnets and lithiumâˆ’ion batteries (LIBs) are critical for a lowâˆ’carbon economy. Their production depends on critical elements like REEs, Li, Co and Ni. Recycling of these products have been explored separately as a potential solution. Conventional methods for recycling NdFeB magnets and LIBs face challenges like high energy consumption, lengthy processing, excessive reagent usage, and waste generation. In this study, a novel synergetic recycling methodology is proposed to minimize these challenges. The idea is based on using waste ferrous sulfate solution generated during magnet leaching as a reducing and leaching reagent for battery recycling thereby eliminating the need for additional reagents for oxidation of iron in NdFeB and reduction of cathode material in LIBs. The magnet is leached in diluted H2SO4 at 70 Â°C followed by double sulfate precipitation for REEs with Na2SO4. The REE-depleted but acidic ferrous solution is then used for reductive leaching of cathode material at 90 Â°C. The overall recovery rates of REEs, Li, Co, Ni, and Mn in this process are >95%.

Under conditions with acetic acid concentration of 1 mol/L, ascorbic acid concentration of 0.1 mol/L, working voltage of 4 V, reaction temperature 25 Â°C and reaction time 70 min, the leaching efficiency of Ni, Co, Mn, and Li reached 99.8%, 99.8%, 99.8%, and 99.9%, respectively. A kinetic study revealed that the surface chemical reaction was the rate-controlling step in the leaching process. The infrared spectra indicated that polyhydroxy groups were transformed into carboxyl or aldehyde groups during mixed acid leaching. The complexity of ascorbic acid and low-valent metal ions increased with leaching time in the ultraviolet spectrum. Finally, the leach residue was analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), which indicated that the metal oxides in the cathode plate were efficiently leached.",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),mixed acid leaching,"acetic acid concentration of 1 mol/L, ascorbic acid concentration of 0.1 mol/L, working voltage of 4 V, reaction temperature of 25 Â°C and reaction time of 70 min","Ni, Co, Mn, Li",25,Nickel (Ni)|Cobalt (Co)|Manganese (Mn)|Lithium (Li),99.8|99.8|99.8|99.9,leaching efficiency,Ni,99.80%,Co,99.80%,Mn,99.80%,Li,99.90%,,,4.56567,5373.599167

However, current recycling methods are mostly faced with the dilemma of high cost and low efficiency and unable to meet the demand for energy conservation and consumption reduction. Here, inspired by the formation of acid mine drainage (AMD), we propose a Fe(III)-driven recovery approach, in which the leaching of valuable metals is enhanced by the addition of solid reagents Fe2(SO4)3 and pyrite (FeS2) to create an acidic reducing atmosphere. Under optimal conditions, the leaching efficiency of Ni/Co/Mn/Li reached 99.9%. In addition, NH3Â·H2O-NaOH was employed to adjust the pH of the leachate for stepwise precipitation of Fe and Ni/Co/Mn. Li was finally collected as Li2CO3 and Fe(III) could be recycled. We have also made attempts on Ni/Co/Mn co-precipitation and Li2CO3 resynthesis of regenerated LiNi x Co y Mn z O 2 (NCM).

This study aims to develop a low-temperature pyro-metallurgical combined process to recycle spent LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523). Unlike traditional pyrometallurgy methods that generate liquid alloys and slags at temperatures exceeding 1000 Â°C, the (NH4)2S2O8 roasting approach operates at 350 Â°C and converts NCM523 to water-soluble sulfates, exhibiting remarkable leaching efficiencies of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn, with values of 99.43â€¯%, 99.87â€¯%, 98.88â€¯%, and 99.19â€¯%, respectively. Systematic studies were conducted to investigate the influence of roasting temperature, (NH4)2S2O8-to-NCM mass ratio, and roasting time on the sulfation process. Furthermore, the mechanism of sulfation reaction was identified by combining experiments with thermodynamic calculation. At temperatures above 160 Â°C, (NH4)2S2O8 decomposes into (NH4)2S2O7, which reacts with NCM. Lithium in a layered structure forms Li2SO4, while transition elements form MnSO4, Li2Co (SO4)2, and NiSO4. At around 350 Â°C, (NH4)2S2O8 further decomposes into NH4HSO4, releasing SO2 and NH3. SO2 reacts with remaining NCM or unsulfated transition metal oxides, converting them into MnSO4, Li2Co (SO4)2, and NiSO4. Above 800 Â°C, the metal sulfates decompose into stable oxides.

An environmentally sound leaching process for the recovery of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn from spent LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2-based LIBs and cathode scraps was investigated in this study. Ehâ€“pH diagrams were used to determine suitable leaching conditions. Operating variables affecting the leaching efficiencies for Li, Ni, Co, and Mn from LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, such as the H2SO4 concentration, temperature, H2O2 concentration, stirring speed, and pulp density, were investigated to determine the most efficient conditions for leaching. The leaching efficiencies for Li, Ni, Co, and Mn reached 99.7% under the optimized conditions of 1M H2SO4, 1vol% H2O2, 400rpm stirring speed, 40g/L pulp density, and 60min leaching time at 40Â°C. The leaching kinetics of LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 were found to be significantly faster than those of LiCoO2. Based on the variation in the weight fraction of the metal in the residue, the â€œcubic rate lawâ€ was revised as follows: Î¸(1âˆ’ f)1/3 =(1âˆ’ kt/r 0 Ï), which could characterize the leaching kinetics optimally. The activation energies were determined to be 64.98, 65.16, 66.12, and 66.04kJ/mol for Li, Ni, Co, and Mn, respectively, indicating that the leaching process was controlled by the rate of surface chemical reactions.

Recovery of valuable metals from spent LIBs is significant to achieve environmental protection and alleviate resource shortages. In this study, a green and facile process for recovery of valuable metals from spent LIBs by waste copperas was proposed. The effects of heat treatment parameters on recovery efficiency of valuable metals and the redox mechanism were studied systematically through phase transformation behavior and valence transition. At low temperature (â‰¤460 Â°C), copperas reacted with lithium on the outer layer of LIBs preferentially, but the reduction of transition metals was limited. As the temperature rose to 460â€“700 Â°C, the extraction efficiency of valuable metals was greatly enhanced due to the generation of SO2, and the gasâ€“solid reaction proceeded much fast than the solidâ€“solid reaction. In the final stage (â‰¥700 Â°C), the main reactions were the thermal decomposition of soluble sulfates and the combination of decomposed oxides with Fe2O3 to form insoluble spinel. Under the optimum roasting conditions, i.e., at a copperas/LIBs mass ratio of 4.5, and a roasting temperature of 650 Â°C and roasting time of 120 min, the leaching efficiencies of Li, Ni, Co and Mn were 99.94%, 99.2%, 99.5% and 99.65%, respectively.

Currently, the main process for separating Cu impurity from spent LIBs by extraction and precipitation has the disadvantage of being high cost and complicated process. In this work, the surface characteristics of spent LIBs materials before and after thermal treatment are explored, and the effects of the concentration of ammonium salts, temperature, and pulp density on the leaching of Cu impurity are investigated. The novel process proposed in this work removes Cu impurities from spent LIBs materials using a solution of (NH4)2CO3 at low concentration. The results suggest that organics on the spent LIBs surface can be effectively removed by heating at a temperature of 505 Â°C to avoid the influence of organics on the removal of Cu impurities. Furthermore, the results of the leaching experiment demonstrate that (NH4)2CO3 displays an excellent leaching effect on Cu compared to NH4Cl, (NH4)2SO4, and NH4HCO3. The leaching efficiency of Cu at the concentration of 0.25 mol/L (NH4)2CO3, temperature 80 Â°C and leaching time of 120 min reaches 99.1%. On the contrary, the leaching efficiencies of Ni, Co, and Mn are <4% on average.

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have shown immense potential for metal extraction from end-of-life (EoL) LIBs. However, a complicated subsequent separation process is required due to the non-selectivity of the DES components for metal. Herein, we propose a tandem precipitant-free hydrometallurgical process for the selective recovery of Li and other valuable metals (Ni, Co, Mn) from EoL LIBs using a green DES. The process parameters, viz., reaction temperature (T), time (t), pulp density (S/L), and molar ratio (MR) of ethylene glycol to tartaric acid, were optimized via the statistical optimization technique of response surface methodology. The results revealed maximum extraction efficiencies of 99.2 Â± 0.5%, 96.1 Â± 1.4%, 95.2 Â± 1.2%, and 97.8 Â± 1.5% for Li, Ni, Co, and Mn, respectively, under the optimized process conditions of T = 118 Â°C, t = 17 min, S/L = 42 g/L, and MR = 3:1.

Nevertheless, among various types of discarded lithium battery electrode materials, limited research has been conducted on the recycling of ternary electrode materials (LiNi x Co y Mn1-x-y O2). This study proposes an eco-friendly process for the efficient recovery of valuable metals and carbon from mixed materials of discarded ternary lithium-ion battery electrodes. This study investigated the influence of various roasting using ammonium sulfate and leaching conditions on the conversion and extraction rates of valuable metals. Under the condition of a 3:1 mass ratio of ammonium sulfate to lithium battery electrode mixed material, roasting temperature of 450 Â°C, roasting time of 30 min, liquid-solid ratio of 20:1, leaching time of 20 min, and leaching temperature of 60 Â°C, the recovery rates of various valuable metals including Li, Ni, Co, and Mn reached 99.99%. For the above process, the chemical control reaction prevailed in the initial 10 min of the roasting reaction, succeeded by the dominance of diffusion control reaction in the subsequent 20 min. In the leaching process, the chemical control reaction governed the first 2 min, succeeded by diffusion control reaction for the next 18 min. Analysis of the reaction's macroscopic and microscopic mechanisms reveals that ammonium sulfate roasting of waste ternary lithium-ion batteries constitutes a typical liquid-solid reaction. In the molten state, NH4 + decomposition releases high-energy H+ ions that break the bonds between metals and oxygen. Consequently, metal atoms from the waste battery's crystal structure combine with ammonium sulfate's sulfate groups, forming various metal sulfates.

Nevertheless, the leaching and efficient separation of the precious metals from NCM active cathode material via an environmentally benign and economical process is still challenging. Therefore, in this research, we present a novel and energy an efficient route through which to leach valuable metals, for example, lithium (Li), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and manganese (Mn) from the NCM cathode material of the waste LIBs using water-containing waste chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in a batch reactor. Parameters such as temperature, time, liquid-solid, and mass ratios on the extraction efficiencies of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn were carefully examined. The outcomes show that CPVC performed better than PVC for the extraction of valuable metals from NCM material, and this was attributed to its high Cl contents.

Conventional precipitation-based hydrometallurgy recycling processes utilise Na-based or metal-based precipitants. The Na, from Na-based precipitants, is present in high concentrations in the process effluent since they are not recovered during the recycling process. The Na-rich effluent cannot be discarded since it doesn't meet environmental regulations as per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (2023) therefore creating a storage and disposal problem. It is therefore imperative to utilise non-Na-based precipitants to eliminate the effluent disposal problem.

Conventional methods often fail to manage large waste volumes, leading to hazardous gas emissions and dangerous materials. This study investigates innovative methods for recovering critical metals from spent LIBs using synergistic leaching. The first step optimized thermal treatment conditions (570 Â°C for 2 h in air) to remove binder materials while maintaining cathode material crystallinity, confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Next, response surface methodology (RSM), I-optimal, was used to examine the synergistic effects of sulfuric acid (SA) and organic acids (Org, citric and acetic acids) and their concentrations (SA: 0.5â€“2 M and Org: 0.1â€“2 M) on metal leaching for an eco-friendlier process. Results showed that adding citric acid to SA was more effective, especially at lower concentrations, than using acetic acid. The medium was tested to evaluate the impact of reductant addition. Remarkably, it was discovered that the optimized leaching mixture (1.25 M SA and 0.55 M citric acid) efficiently extracted metals without the need for any reductant like H2O2, highlighting its potential for a simpler and more eco-friendly recycling process.

Special conditions to achieve high lithium recovery and its use in new batteries represent a challenge for a commercial hydrometallurgical approach. In this work, an early selective recovery of lithium using oxalic acid as a leaching agent is investigated. The different solubility of transition metals oxalates in comparison to lithium oxalate was the main driving force to achieve selective separation in the leaching step. Nickel, cobalt, and manganese oxalates are insoluble and remained in the solid residue, while lithium oxalate was dissolved in the solution. Using a design of experiments to optimize the operation, optimal parameters were identified as 60 Â°C, 60 min, 0.6 M oxalic acid, resulting in 98.8% leaching yield for lithium, while less than 0.5 % of cobalt and nickel, and 1.5% of manganese were leached.

Here research demonstrates that in-situ reduction pretreatment could dramatically improve the leaching efficiencies for valuable metals from cathodes. Specifically, calcination under 600 Â°C without oxygen using alkali treated cathode can induce in-situ reduction and collapse of oxygen framework, which is ascribed to the carbon inherently contained in the sample and promote the following efficient leaching without external reductants. The leaching efficiencies of Li, Mn, Co and Ni can remarkably reach 100%, 98.13%, 97.27% and 97.37% respectively. Characterization methods, such as XRD, XPS and SEM-EDS, were employed and revealed that during in-situ reduction, high valence metals such as Ni3+, Co3+, Mn4+ can be effectively reduced to lower valence states, conducive to subsequent leaching reactions. Moreover, leaching processes of Ni, Co and Mn fit well with the film diffusion control model, and the reaction barrier is in accordance with the order of Ni, Co and Mn. In comparison, it is observed that Li was leached with higher efficiency regardless of the various pretreatments.

The process comprises an acid leaching followed by the resynthesis of a cathode material from the resulting leachate. Spent cathode materials were leached in citric acid (C6H8O7) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Optimal leaching conditions were obtained at a leaching temperature of 90 Â°C, a H2O2 concentration of 1.5â€¯vol%, a leaching time of 60 min, a pulp density of 20â€¯gâ€¯Lâˆ’1, and a citric acid concentration of 0.5â€¯M.

In this work, the effects of incineration on the leaching efficiency of metals from EV LIBs were evaluated. The thermal process was applied as a pre-treatment for the electrode material, aiming for carbothermic reduction of the valuable metals by the graphite contained in the waste. Leaching efficiencies above 70% were obtained for Li, Mn, Ni and Co after 60 min of leaching even when using 0.5 M sulfuric acid, which can be linked to the formation of more easily leachable compounds during the incineration process. When the incineration temperature was increased (600â€“700 Â°C), the intensity of graphite signals decreased and other oxides were identified, possibly due to the increase in oxidative conditions.

In the traditional recovery process of spent LIBs, the leaching of high-valence metals has the problems of high cost and limited reagent utilization, and some valuable metals are lost in the subsequent purification process of the leaching solution. To reduce the cost of reagents, this study proposes the use of low-cost SO2 as a reagent combined with pressure leaching to efficiently recover high-valence metals from delithiated materials of spent LIBs, while selective solvent extraction is used to remove trace impurities in the leaching solution to avoid the loss of valuable metals.

Hydrometallurgical derived full-component separation strategy has been verified as the most capable recycling process for LiFePO4 cathode. During which, complete elements (i.e., Li, Fe and P) are dissolved into a solution of excessive acidic leachate, and subsequently separated to obtain battery-grade FePO4Â·2H2O and lithium salt, enabling high element recovery rates of up to 100 %. However, the use of excessive leaching agent leads to high acidity of the leaching solution (pH < 0.8), which brings a necessary of pH regulation prior to the regeneration of FePO4Â·2H2O, markedly complicating the succedent separation and purification. In this investigation, a practical method for directly regenerating FePO4Â·2H2O from H2SO4-based full-component leaching solution is proposed. In this process, H2SO4 as leaching agent is used to digest LiFePO4 completely, and then Fe and P are premeditatedly recovered from the extremely acidic filtrate (pH < 0.8) as FePO4Â·2H2O via direct precipitation without any pH regulator. Consequently, there are no extra impurities affecting the recovery of Fe and P during regeneration. The regeneration behavior of FePO4Â·2H2O under extremely acidic condition are investigated and the growth mechanism is also clarified by monitoring the overall microstructure and phase evolutions. The results demonstrate that the above regeneration is found to be an exponential growth process driven by the quantity of nucleation site, and meanwhile influenced by the dissolution-reprecipitation equilibrium of amorphous iron phosphate. Specifically, the process can be accelerated by introducing FePO4Â·2H2O or amorphous iron phosphate to increase the nucleation sites.

Herein, the proposed process fully utilizes cheap ammonium sulfate as sulfating agent and aluminum foil of spent lithium-ion batteries itself as reducing agent for synergistically roasting the cathode material. Thermodynamic analysis and experimental results show that, different from conventional sulfation and thermite reduction roasting, aluminum synergistic sulfation roasting converts Li in the cathode material to water-soluble Li2SO4 instead of LiMn2O4 and LiAlO2, and reduces transition metals to acid-soluble low-valent oxides instead of high-valent oxides or metal elements. The effects of roasting temperature, ammonium sulfate dosage, and roasting time on the phase transformation were studied. Under the optimal roasting parameters (T = 600 Â°C, n[(NH4)2SO4]:n(2Li) = 1.4, t = 1.0 h) of spent ternary cathode, the water leaching efficiency of Li is 97.2 % with less than 0.5 % of Al and transition metals being co-leached. Subsequently, more than 96 % of Al and 99 % of transition metals can be extracted through alkaline and non-reducing agent acid leaching, respectively.

Numerous studies have focused on utilizing high temperatures or strong acid/alkali to reduce the spent active cathode material to a low valence state, which exacerbates recycling and post-treatment costs. Herein, a low-temperature roasting process followed by a water leaching strategy is developed to recycle and regenerate LiCoO2 cathode material from spent LiCoO2 batteries. The spent LiCoO2 is roasted with glucose (C6H12O6) as a reagent to attain reduction of the cathode material into water-soluble Li salt (Li2O and Li2CO3) and water-insoluble (Co and CoO). The proposed method utilizes moderate roasting temperature and water as the only leaching reagent, which effectively reduces energy and chemical consumption. Li and Co recovery rates are 97 % and 99 %, respectively, under the optimal conditions of 1 h roasting at 550 Â°C followed by 30 min water leaching using a solidâ€“liquid ratio of 50 g/L. The recovered Li-rich solution and Co-rich residue can be easily converted to Li2CO3 and Co3O4, respectively, which are the precursors for regenerating the LiCoO2 cathode material. The regenerated LiCoO2 exhibits superior cycling stability with 87 % capacity retention after 800 cycles at 4.4 V.

In terms of environmental restrictions and circular economy, proper treatment of spent LIBs is of great significance for achieving sustainable development. In this study, organic p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA) was employed to recycle valuable Li and Co elements from the spent LIBs for production of battery raw materials (e.g. Li2CO3 and Co3O4). Operation parameters such as PTSA concentration, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration, solid-to-liquid ratio, leaching temperature and leaching time, were systematically investigated.

With the rapid development of portable electronics, more than 100,000 tons of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are produced every year. Conventional battery recycling processes including pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes mainly aim at extracting valuable metallic components from spent LIB cathodes, which requires high temperature reduction and/or acid/alkali chemicals to destroy covalent bond in cathodes and convert them into atoms for further extraction. The former leads to high energy consumption and the latter produces a lot of wastewater, which not only increases cost, but also damages our environment. Moreover, traditional recycling starts from spent battery cathodes and ends up with lithium/cobalt salts, which is unsustainable. Herein, a different recycling strategy to directly convert degraded LiCoO2 into high-voltage LiCoO2 cathode materials was proposed, featuring a closed-loop and green procedure. The directly-converted LiCoO2 from spent cathodes exhibits excellent cyclability at 4.5 V with a high capacity retention of 97.4% after 100 cycles, even superior than pristine LiCoO2.

In this study, a novel approach for recycling valuable metals from spent LiCoO2 batteries via co-pyrolysis with three different carbonaceous materials (waste polyethylene, biomass, and coal)) was proposed and evaluated. The thermodynamic analysis proved that carbonaceous materials (mainly carbon) were theoretically able to facilitate the decomposition process of LiCoO2. The promotion effect on LiCoO2 decomposition was in the following order: coal > biomass > polyethylene, and the decomposition temperature of LiCoO2 could significantly reduce by 400 Â°C via adding coal. The char produced from the carbonaceous materials, rather than the volatiles, played an important role in LiCoO2 decomposition and reduction. The pyrolysis products of LiCoO2 and coal mixture exhibited typical superparamagnetism and hysteresis behaviours, which benefitted the subsequent magnetic separation. The recovery rates of Co and Li were sensitive to the pyrolysis temperature and residence time, respectively.

Herein, a NaOH-assisted low-temperature roasting approach is proposed to recover spent LiFePO4. During roasting, NaOH acts as an oxidizing agent to oxidize Fe (II) to Fe3O4 at 150Â°C, thus collapsing its stable olivine structure while PO4 3- capturing Li+ and Na+ to form Li2NaPO4 and LiNa5(PO4)2. The obtained Fe3O4 is then separated, and the resulting Li salt can be further recovered as Li3PO4 with a Li recovery efficiency of 96.7 % and a purity of 99.9 %. Economic and environmental analysis based on the EverBatt model shows that this low-temperature strategy reduces energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thus increasing the potential profit.

Herein, a novel reduction roasting approach relying on spent LIB separator to refine the spent cathode is proposed. The efficiency of repurposing separator as a reductant for roasting the spent LiCoO2 cathode and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. After the separator-mediated roasting at 500 Â°C for 2 h, Li+ leaching efficiency of the cathode reached 93.2 %, >2.6 times higher than those after roasting without reductant (25.2 %) or with benchmark reductant graphite (26.1 %). Under the separator-added roasting condition, the cathode was converted to the desired products, CoO and Li2CO3. Based on the analysis of in-situ reaction using thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry and pyrolysis gas species identification, the separator-mediated reduction roasting of cathode was composed of two stages, i.e., reducing gas generation due to separator pyrolysis, followed by the reducing gas mediated LiCoO2 reduction.

For example, precious metals are vital to manufacture crystalline silicon solar panel and tellurium, germanium, indium and gallium are essential in thin film photovoltaic panels. However, the pressure on the supply of critical metals increases with the growth of photovoltaics. Considering the resource availability, the recycling of critical metals from waste solar panels can enhance the sustainability of end-of-life management, although the recycled metal input is limited in present state. Among the recycling techniques, the separation and liberation of metals from non-metals are crucial. This study investigate a methodology to liberate thin film materials from copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) thin-film solar panel to recycle photovoltaic material including indium and gallium via a mechanical process. An experimental technique using mineral processing techniques, crushing and grinding, are proposed to recycle critical metals from CIGS solar panel. In this study, the crushing experiments were conducted and the size based elemental distribution was analysed. The results showed crushing is capable to delaminate glass substrate and Fuerstenau upgrading curves and the ore separation degree were used to show that selective liberation occurs and the critical metals concentrate in coarse size fraction but may not be fully liberated. The morphology test using SEM-EDS to observe the surface of broken panel and the classification of broken particle based on size, metal concentration and surface morphology were conducted.

This study proposes a novel method for reutilizing metal resources from TLBs. Through selective oxidation, manganese in a leaching solution of TLBs was converted into MnO2 with Î±, Î³, and Î´ crystal phases (referred to as T-MnO2) for catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), while efficiently separating manganese from high-value metals such as nickel, cobalt, and lithium, achieving a manganese recovery rate of 99.99%.

The cathode active materials from spent battery were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before and after leaching. Effects of leaching time, leaching temperature, H2SO4 concentration, H2O2 concentration, solid/liquid ratio, and ultrasonic power have been studied. Optimal leaching efficiency of 94.63% for cobalt, and 98.62% for lithium, respectively, was achieved by using 2â€¯M H2SO4 with 5%â€¯(v/v) H2O2 at a solid/liquid ratio of 100â€¯g/L, and an ultrasonic power of 360â€¯W, and the leaching time being 30â€¯min under 30â€¯Â°C. Compared with conventional leaching, the ultrasound-assisted leaching gave a higher leaching rate and improved leaching efficiency under the same experimental conditionals. The kinetic analysis of ultrasound-assisted leaching showed that the activation energy of cobalt and lithium were 3.848â€¯KJ/mol and 11.6348â€¯KJ/mol, respectively, indicating that ultrasound-assisted leaching of cobalt and lithium from spent LIBs was controlled by diffusion.",nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries,pyrolysis,"1000â€¯Â°C, 2â€¯h, 40â€¯vol.% CO2, 20â€¯vol.% H2O",nickel and cobalt,1000,Cobalt (Co)|Lithium (Li),94.63|98.62,leaching efficiency,Co,94.63%,Li,98.62%,,,,,,,176.136,389497.08

In this paper, we report a new process for selective extraction of lithium from spent lithium-ion power batteries by roasting a mixture of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 and NaHSO4Â·H2O followed by water leaching. The most suitable conditions included roasting LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2:NaHSO4Â·H2O at 600 Â°C for 30 min in a mass ratio of 1:1.40, followed by water leaching at 60 Â°C for 30 min with a liquid/solid ratio of 25:1 (mL/g). Under the optimal conditions, extraction efficiencies of 99.3%, 0.01%, 3.69%, and 3.90% for Li, Mn, Co, and Ni, respectively, were obtained. X-ray diffraction, in situ X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetryâ€“differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetryâ€“mass spectrometry were performed to investigate the transformation of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn in the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2â€“NaHSO4Â·H2O roasting system. The results demonstrated that the SO3 produced by thermal decomposition of NaHSO4Â·H2O considerably affected the transformation of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn in the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2. The surface morphology of the roasted samples showed evidence of sintering and agglomeration. The thermodynamic analysis indicated that the roasting reaction is feasible and that the selective extraction of Li can be achieved by controlling the additive ratio of NaHSO4Â·H2O.","rechargeable batteries, waste saggar",leaching process,5–80 °C,lithium,80,Lithium (Li)|Manganese (Mn)|Cobalt (Co)|Nickel (Ni),99.3|0.01|3.69|3.9,extraction efficiency,Li,99.30%,Mn,0.01%,Co,3.69%,Ni,3.90%,,,58.45,252202.14
20,10.1016/j.jece.2022.109160,Rare metals recycling from spent NCM cathode materials and simultaneous dehydrofluorination of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in subcritical water,"Several studies have examined the recovery of lithium (Li), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and manganese (Mn) from used lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the environmentally friendly and cost-effective leaching and efficient separation of rare metals from the active cathode material of LIBs remains a challenge. In this study, we present a novel route for the extraction of high-value metals from the NCM cathode material of spent LIBs using subcritical water-containing polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The experimental parameters such as reaction temperature, time, liquidâ€“solid and mass ratios, were carefully investigated. The raw cathode material and the solid residues before and after leaching were characterized using ICP-OES, XRD, FT-IR and SEM-EDS analyses. Results showed that the maximum extraction efficiencies of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn of (98.69, 98.24, 97.52, and 99.04) %, respectively, were achieved under the optimized conditions of 350 Â°C, 2 h, 1:3 mass ratio, and 60:1 mL/g liquidâ€“solid ratio. Meanwhile, the experimental results of leaching kinetics revealed that the reaction in the system was controlled by the surface chemical reaction model with the linear fitting degree of (R2 = 0.97â€“0.99) and the calculated activation energies of 63.72 kJ/mol (for Li), 73.55 kJ/mol (for Ni), 74.99 kJ/mol (for Co), and 71.88 kJ/mol (for Mn). The overall findings of this research concluded that the PVDF-assisted subcritical water extraction process is a beneficial and a promising alternative to other existing methods.",zinc-carbon batteries,Low temperature roasting technique,800 °C and 900 °C,zinc and manganese,900,Lithium (Li)|Nickel (Ni)|Cobalt (Co)|Manganese (Mn),98.69|98.24|97.52|99.04,extraction efficiency,Li,98.69%,Ni,98.24%,Co,97.52%,Mn,99.04%,,,Can't be calculated,Can't be calculated
