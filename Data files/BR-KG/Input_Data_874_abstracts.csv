Part 1: Lead citrate synthesis from PbO and PbO2,"In this study, as part of developing a new process which can avoid smelting and electro-winning, citric acid based reagents in aqueous media were reacted with PbO and PbO2. These two oxides are important components in the spent lead-acid battery paste and together account for up to 50% of the paste by weight. PbSO4, the main component in a spent battery paste accounting for the remaining 50%, is dealt with in Part 2 in a separate paper. Reaction between PbO and C6H8O7Â·H2O or PbO2 with a mixture of C6H8O7Â·H2O and H2O2 yielded lead citrate, Pb(C6H6O7)Â·H2O, which was characterised by XRD, SEM and FT-IR analysis. Optimal synthesis conditions were determined by investigating the effect of time, temperature, concentration, and the starting Pb oxide/water ratio. The optimal condition for leaching a mol of PbO at room temperature (20 Â°C) was found to be: 1 mol of (C6H8O7)Â·H2O solution; 1/3 as the starting PbO/water ratio and 15 min of reaction time. Pure citrate product, Pb(C6H6O7)Â·H2O was rapidly crystallized from the solution, in the leaching process. Leaching of PbO2 required the use of a mild reducing agent. For each mole of PbO2, the optimum condition at 20 Â°C was found to be: a solution containing 4 mol of C6H8O7Â·H2O and 2 mol of H2O2; 1/5 as the starting solid PbO2/water ratio; and 60 min of reaction time. The product, as with PbO, was pure Pb(C6H6O7)Â·H2O compound. The remaining lead content of the filtrate solution was 0.017% and 1% corresponding to recoveries of 99.98% and 99% of lead as citrate, after the leaching/crystallization/filtration process with PbO and PbO2, respectively. Asymmetric stretching vibrations between 1599 and 1662 cmâˆ’1, whereas symmetric vibrations between 1520 and 1327 cmâˆ’1 for lead citrate synthesised from PbO and asymmetric stretching vibrations between 1600 and 1642 cmâˆ’1 as well as symmetric vibrations between 1517 and 1326 cmâˆ’1 for the product obtained from PbO2 revealed the strong IR adsorptions associated with a carboxylate structure. XRD data was identical to the well documented crystalline Pb(C6H6O7)Â·H2O compound from both the oxides. SEM revealed the formation of plate/sheet like morphologies. The difference in the column size of the Pb(C6H6O7)Â·H2O formed from the two lead oxides can be related to difference in the rate of the respective reactions.",Lead Acid Battery,"XRD, SEM and FT-IR analysis, leaching, crystallization, filtration","20 °C, reaction time: 15 min","Lead Citrate, Pb(C6H6O7)·H2O",20
2,10.1016/j.ceja.2023.100582,Recovery of NixMnyCoz(OH)2 and Li2CO3 from spent Li-ionB cathode leachates using non-Na precipitant-based chemical precipitation for sustainable recycling,"The interest in recycling spent lithium-ion batteries (Li-ionB) has surged due to the rising demand for valuable metals (e.g., Co, Ni, Li and Mn) and concerns about environmental repercussions emanating from conventional battery waste disposal. Conventional precipitation-based hydrometallurgy recycling processes utilise Na-based or metal-based precipitants. The Na, from Na-based precipitants, is present in high concentrations in the process effluent since they are not recovered during the recycling process. The Na-rich effluent cannot be discarded since it doesn't meet environmental regulations as per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (2023) therefore creating a storage and disposal problem. It is therefore imperative to utilise non-Na-based precipitants to eliminate the effluent disposal problem. This paper focuses on the recovery of NixCoyMnz(OH)2 and Li2CO3, main precursors for Li-ionB cathode production, from a typical spent Li-ionB cathode (NMC 532) using non-Na precipitant-based chemical precipitation. This study reports NixCoyMnz(OH)2 and Li2CO3 recovery from spent Li-ionBs for closed-loop Li-ionB cathode recycling through an integrated hydrometallurgy and chemical precipitation process. Through the utilisation of leachate solutions comprising 2 M H2SO4 + 6 vol.% H2O2, and a 75 g/L S/L ratio and conducting leaching for 120 min at a temperature of 60 Â°C and IS of 350 rpm, the recovery efficiency of 98.1 % for Li, 97.1 % for Co, 96.1 % for Ni, and 95.7 % for Mn. The pH of the NMC leachate was initially adjusted to 5 to precipitate Fe, Al and Cu impurities. Thereafter, active metal species (Ni, Mn and Co) were precipitated at a pH of 13 as Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3(OH)2 composite microparticles by adding LiOH precipitant. Thereafter, the Li-rich resultant liquor was further used to recover the Li by adding 3.4 mol of CO2 bubbled at 0.068 mol (CO2)/L.min and 40 Â°C for 45 min. The Li2CO3 precipitates were separated from the suspension through filtration followed by washing using deionised water and hot air drying. The reaction time is 45 mins, and the agitation speed is 150 rpm. Through this multi-stage precipitation process, >98 % of Ni, Co, Mn and > 91 % of Li can be recovered in the form of Ni0.5Mn0.3Co0.2(OH)2 and Li2CO3 respectively. The process exhibits great potential for recovery of valuable materials from spent Li-ionBs. The recovered Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3(OH)2 and Li2CO3 materials will be used as precursors in the anhydrous NMC cathode production process.",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),Precipitation-based hydrometallurgy,"60 °C, reaction time: 120 min, 350 rpm IS","NixCoyMnz(OH)2, Li2CO3",60

Nevertheless, research on the regeneration of WCR was seldom reported. Herein, a new environmentally friendly process of low-temperature fluorination roasting and water leaching technology were proposed to achieve optimal purification of WCR. And the transformation mechanism of water-soluble complex ions during fluorination roasting was investigated via DFTB indicating that the ionic bond of F and NH4 group in NH4F broken than form stable covalent bond with metal ions. This process showed that 99.59%, 99.54%, 99.82%, 96.38%, 98.41%, 97.28%, 99.23%, and 98.61% of cobalt, nickel, manganese, aluminum, silicon, iron, lithium, and sulfur in WCR could be removed under optimal conditions. Meanwhile, the high-Purity graphite carbon (PGC) products with purity of 99.98% were obtained. In particular, PGC in half-cell exhibited a stable specific capacity of 340.9 mAh/g and high ICE of 92.13%, and with a more than 96% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1C, much better performance than WCR and similarly to commercial graphite. Moreover, the discharge capacity of PGC in full-cell was 2302.82 mAh at 0.2C rate with 87.3% ICE. The capacity retention maintained at 96% after 400 cycles at 1C/1C rate. Subsequently, the valuable components in leaching solution were recovered with ammonia as precipitant. The precipitation rates of Al, Co, Mn, Ni, and Si were 99.25%, 81.74%, 98.20%, 62.43% and 86.68%, respectively. Besides, exhaust gas was absorbed in fluorine-containing leachate for recovery of ammonium fluoride products by evaporation crystallization. This proposed process with circular economy and green chemistry characteristics is expected to be employed in the regeneration of WCR while recovering valuable components.",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),"low-temperature fluorination roasting, water leaching technology, evaporation crystallization","Half-cell: 340.9 mAh/g, 92.13% ICE, Full-cell: 2302.82 mAh, 0.2C rate, 87.3% ICE","Al, Co, Mn, Ni, Si, high-Purity graphite carbon (PGC), ammonium fluoride",
4,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.140798,Sustainable regeneration of high-performance cathode materials from spent lithium-ion batteries through magnetic separation and coprecipitation,"Extensive research and application of recycling methods for spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been undertaken in recent years with great success. However, the separation of valuable metals from the lixivium of spent LIBs, which contains Al, Cu, Ni, Co, Mn, and Li, is complicated, burdensome, and unsustainable. Therefore, there is a need to establish a more sustainable and energy-efficient method for recycling spent LIBs. The study introduced an innovative methodology for replacing the impurity ion removal process in the lixivium with magnetic separation pretreatment. Then, the co-precipitation method was used to directly resynthesize LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (LNCM523) with recovered metals as raw materials. The results demonstrate that, with a magnetic field intensity of 3000 Oe and feed particle size of âˆ’0.074 mm, the magnetic separation concentrates the following grades: Ni-26.34%, Co-14.26%, Mn-28.30%, Al-0.23%, and Cu-0.41%. The corresponding recovery rates were also determined as follows: Ni-92.57%, Co-94.16%, Mn-85.68%, Al-1.62%, and Cu-2.14%. The total impurities (Al, Cu, and Fe) in the lixivium obtained by magnetic separation concentrate under conventional acid leaching conditions were below 0.05 wt%, while the contents of Ni, Co, and Mn were measured at 13.08 g/L, 7.10 g/L, and 14.06 g/L, respectively. Spherical LNCM523 was successfully regenerated from the lixivium through co-precipitation and sintering. The LNCM523 demonstrated exceptional electrochemical performance, exhibiting a notable initial discharge capacity of 173.9 mAh/g at 0.2 C and remarkable cycling stability with 91.9% retention over 100 cycles at 0.5 C. In comparison to the conventional approach, this method circumvented the intricate procedure of separating metal ions, thereby realizing the resource regeneration of cathode materials and enabling a closed-circuit recycling process. These advancements contributed to fostering sustainable low-carbon development of the spent LIBs.",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),"magnetic separation pretreatment, co-precipitation","magnetic field intensity: 3000 Oe, feed particle size: 0.074 mm"," Al, Cu, Ni, Co, Mn, Li, LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (LNCM523)",
5,10.1016/j.rineng.2024.102802,Optimization of high-temperature thermal pretreatment conditions for maximum enrichment of lithium and cobalt from spent lithium-ion polymer batteries,"Due to their increasingly high demand, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) will encounter a scarcity of essential resources if recycling is not prioritized. The current pretreatment methods for spent LIBs used in industrial production are inefficient, costly, and hazardous. The study aimed to maximize the yield of lithium and cobalt from the black mass of spent Lithium-ion batteries through an optimized high-temperature thermal pretreatment process, which combined mechanical (direct crushing) and thermal treatments to facilitate the subsequent recovery of these valuable metals. Sieve analysis showed that direct crushing for 2 min resulted in 40.81 % of the anode material in the 4750 + 2500 Î¼m size range, while 5 min of crushing led to a more even distribution, with 28.57 % in the smallest size range (âˆ’75 Î¼m). Heat treatment followed by 2 min of crushing concentrated 52.38 % of the anode material in the 4750 + 2500 Î¼m range. For the cathode material, 2 min of direct crushing distributed 24.49 % in the âˆ’2500 + 1250 Î¼m range, while 5 min of crushing accumulated 38.80 % in the âˆ’75 Î¼m range. Heat treatment and 2 min of crushing resulted in 56.05 % of the cathode material in the âˆ’75 Î¼m range, indicating improved liberation. The combination of heat treatment and mechanical treatment effectively liberates and reduces the size of the active materials, resulting in a higher cumulative mass fraction of finer particles (â‰¤630 Î¼m). Heat treatment at 600 Â°C for 15 min, followed by 2 min of crushing, dissociated current collectors (Al) from the cathode material, minimized the harmful gas emissions and produced fine particles (630 Î¼m) with minimal Al content (0.8 wt%). The optimal heat treatment condition of 600 Â°C for 35 min achieved complete decomposition of PVDF and enriched 73.49 wt% cobalt and 5.41 wt% lithium in the black mass, superior to previous studies.",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),"optimized high-temperature thermal pretreatment , mechanical (direct crushing), thermal treatment","600 °C for 35 min, 2 min: crushing","lithium, cobalt ",600
6,10.1016/j.cep.2021.108507,Process intensification for valuable metals leaching from spent NiMH batteries,"Acid leaching is an essential unit in hydrometallurgy, yet it is time consuming and requires concentrated acids. Process intensification is examined for the leaching of valuable and rare earth elements (REEs), such as Ni, Co, La, Nd, and Ce, from spent nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries using subcritical water extraction (SWE) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). Results of SWE revealed that HCl performed better than H2SO4 and HNO3. Leaching efficiency increased as reaction temperature increased from 100 to 150Â°C, and it increased with HCl concentration. SWE was very effective using 0.5 N HCl, solid concentration of 20 g/L, initial pressure of 9.8 bar, 100Â°C for 5 min, and leaching efficiency of 99.85% for Ni, 91.72% for Co, 96.26% for La, 85.75% for Nd, and 84.37% for Ce was found, and the total energy consumption was 2,640 kJ. Leaching efficiency of MAE using 0.5 N HCl decreased slightly when heating rate increased from 30 to 70Â°C/min, and it increased as reaction time increased from 5 to 30 min. Compared with SWE and conventional leaching, MAE was the most energy-efficient, and total of 874.1 kJ was required to reach 85.93% for Ni, 77.60% for Co, 64.04% for La, 75.01% for Nd, and 57.17% for Ce, respectively under experimental conditions of 1 N of HCl, solid concentration of 20 g/L, 100Â°C for 5 min.

7,10.1016/j.jece.2024.113521,Recovery of valuable metal elements from spent lithium-ion battery via a low temperature ammonium persulfate roasting approach,"A low-cost and eco-friendly recycling method is crucial for recovering valuable elements from end-of-life lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which plays a vital role in addressing resource scarcity and reducing the environmental impact. This study aims to develop a low-temperature pyro-metallurgical combined process to recycle spent LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523). Unlike traditional pyrometallurgy methods that generate liquid alloys and slags at temperatures exceeding 1000 Â°C, the (NH4)2S2O8 roasting approach operates at 350 Â°C and converts NCM523 to water-soluble sulfates, exhibiting remarkable leaching efficiencies of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn, with values of 99.43â€¯%, 99.87â€¯%, 98.88â€¯%, and 99.19â€¯%, respectively. Systematic studies were conducted to investigate the influence of roasting temperature, (NH4)2S2O8-to-NCM mass ratio, and roasting time on the sulfation process. Furthermore, the mechanism of sulfation reaction was identified by combining experiments with thermodynamic calculation. At temperatures above 160 Â°C, (NH4)2S2O8 decomposes into (NH4)2S2O7, which reacts with NCM. Lithium in a layered structure forms Li2SO4, while transition elements form MnSO4, Li2Co (SO4)2, and NiSO4. At around 350 Â°C, (NH4)2S2O8 further decomposes into NH4HSO4, releasing SO2 and NH3. SO2 reacts with remaining NCM or unsulfated transition metal oxides, converting them into MnSO4, Li2Co (SO4)2, and NiSO4. Above 800 Â°C, the metal sulfates decompose into stable oxides.

8,10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123156,Recycling lead from waste lead-acid batteries by the combination of low temperature alkaline and bath smelting,"Recycling lead from waste lead-acid batteries has substantial significance in environmental protection and economic growth. Bearing the merits of easy operation and large capacity, pyrometallurgy methods are mostly used for the regeneration of waste lead-acid battery (LABs). However, these processes are generally operated at the temperature higher than 1300 Â°C. To shorten the energy consumption, a novel pyrometallurgy process which consisted of low temperature alkaline and bath smelting was proposed in this work. The reduction of lead and smelting of slag system are the key factors determine the energy consumption. Thermodynamic calculation suggested that the addition of Na2CO3 can make the reduction of PbSO4 spontaneously at the temperature higher than 288 Â°C (PbSO4 â†’ PbCO3 â†’ PbO â†’ Pb), while direct reduction of PbSO4 necessitated the temperature higher than 1499 Â°C (PbSO4 â†’ PbO â†’ Pb). To achieve the efficient reduction of PbSO4, the molar ratios of C/PbSO4 and Na2CO3/PbSO4 should be higher than 0.5 and 1.0, respectively. Meanwhile, a new smelting system (i.e., FeO-SiO2-CaO-Na2O) was established in the presence of Na2CO3. Phases with low melting temperatures, such as NaFe2O3, Na2FeSiO4, Na2Ca2Si2O7, Na14Fe6O16 and Na0.5FeO2, were formed. The melting temperature of Fe-Si-Ca-Na system was lowered to 1050 Â°C at the mass dosage of Na2CO3 at 30%. Recovery of lead under various reduction conditions were systematically evaluated. Under optimum operational conditions, i.e., the dosages of C and Na2CO3 at 10% and m(actual)/m(theory) ratio of 1.3 (all in mass), smelting temperature of 1050 Â°C, and smelting time of 75 min, respectively, the lead recovery efficiency reached >98.0%. Moreover, this method has been successfully applied for the industrial recovery of lead at the scale of 200, 000 tons annually since 2019. Taken together, this method is robust for recovery of lead from the waste LABs and is helpful for building the resource-conserving society.",Lead Acid Battery,low temperature alkaline and bath smelting,"1050 °C, smelting time: 75 min ",lead,1050
9,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.006,Recycling of the anode from spent Ni-MH batteries for synthesis of the lanthanide oxysulfide/oxysulfate compounds used in an oxygen storage and release system,"In this work, lanthanide oxysulfide/oxysulfate compounds, denominated as an oxygen storage and release system, have been synthesized from the anode electrodes of spent Ni-MH batteries. The rare earth metals have recovered by means of chemical precipitation as a mixture of La2(SO4)3, Ce2(SO4)3, and Nd2(SO4)3. The synthesis of (LaÂ·Nd)O2SÂ·CeO2 have been carried out by subjecting a mixture of La2(SO4)3, Ce2(SO4)3, and Nd2(SO4)3 to a heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere up to 1000 Â°C. The (LaÂ·Nd)O2SO4Â·CeO2 compounds have been obtained after thermal treatment of (LaÂ·Nd)O2SÂ·CeO2 in a synthetic air atmosphere. The oxysulfide/oxysulfate compounds have been subjected to thermal cycles, respectively, in synthetic air as well as in an N2â€“CO atmosphere. The thermogravimetric plot (TG) for (LaÂ·Nd)2O2SÂ·CeO2 shows a mass gain of 14.98% w/w in a temperature range of 300â€“550 Â°C, which is due to the oxidation of (LaÂ·Nd)2O2SÂ·CeO2 to (LaÂ·Nd)2O2SO4CeO2, where 2 mol of O2 are added. Likewise, in the (LaÂ·Nd)2O2SO4CeO2 thermogravimetric plot, a mass loss of 17.16% w/w is observed in the range of 500â€“750 Â°C. This loss of mass can be associated with output of 2 mol of O2 forming again the (LaÂ·Nd)2O2SÂ·CeO2.

10,10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118205,Removal of polyvinylidene fluoride binder and other organics for enhancing the leaching efficiency of lithium and cobalt from black mass,"The agglomeration and encapsulation of recoverable materials of interest (e.g. metals and graphite) as a result of the presence of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with mixed chemistries (black mass) lower the extraction efficiency of metals. In this study, organic solvents and alkaline solutions were used as non-toxic reagents to investigate the removal of a PVDF binder from a black mass. The results demonstrated that 33.1%, 31.4%, and 31.4% of the PVDF were removed using dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMAc), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 150, 160, and 180 Â°C, respectively. Under these conditions, the peel-off efficiencies for DMF, DMAc, and DMSO were 92.9%, 85.3%, and approximately 92.9%, respectively. Using tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a catalyst and 5 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at room temperature (RT- 21 Â°Câ€“23 Â°C), 50.3% of PVDF and other organic compounds were eliminated. The removal efficiency was enhanced to approximately 60.5% when the temperature was raised to 80 Â°C using NaOH . Using 5 M potassium hydroxide at RT in a TBAB-containing solution, ca. 32.8% removal efficiency was obtained; raising the temperature to 80 Â°C further enhanced the removal efficiency to almost 52.7%. The peel-off efficiency was 100% for both alkaline solutions. Lithium extraction increased from 47.2% to 78.7% following treatment with DMSO and to 90.1% following treatment with NaOH via leaching black mass (2 M sulfuric acid, solid-to-liquid ratio (S/L): 100 g Lâ€“1 at 50 Â°C, for 1 h without a reducing agent) before and after removal of the PVDF binder.

An environmentally sound leaching process for the recovery of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn from spent LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2-based LIBs and cathode scraps was investigated in this study. Ehâ€“pH diagrams were used to determine suitable leaching conditions. Operating variables affecting the leaching efficiencies for Li, Ni, Co, and Mn from LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, such as the H2SO4 concentration, temperature, H2O2 concentration, stirring speed, and pulp density, were investigated to determine the most efficient conditions for leaching. The leaching efficiencies for Li, Ni, Co, and Mn reached 99.7% under the optimized conditions of 1M H2SO4, 1vol% H2O2, 400rpm stirring speed, 40g/L pulp density, and 60min leaching time at 40Â°C. The leaching kinetics of LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 were found to be significantly faster than those of LiCoO2.

The activation energies were determined to be 64.98, 65.16, 66.12, and 66.04kJ/mol for Li, Ni, Co, and Mn, respectively, indicating that the leaching process was controlled by the rate of surface chemical reactions.

Two different strategies were applied: acid leaching of a washed residue and alkaline leaching of the original residue. In both (acid and alkaline) approaches, the use of microwave- or ultrasound-assisted leaching increased the extraction of Zn compared with the best results obtained using conventional leaching [acid leaching (1.5mol/L H2SO4, 3h, 80Â°C), 90% of Zn extracted; alkaline leaching (6mol/L NaOH, 3h, 80Â°C), 42% of Zn extracted].

Chemical composition analysis confirmed that the battery used in this work was composed of NCM cathode with high-nickel content and graphite anode material. The average particle size of the obtained BP was 87 Î¼m. In order to obtain the residue having high concentration of carbon, the metal extraction was applied using an HCl solution. As a result, metals (Li, Ni, Co, Mn, Al, Cu, and Fe) in the final remnant were found to be less than 2%, and carbon was found to have a purity of 97% or more. The obtained BP was tested as both the adsorbent and support for indoor CO2 capture. Various activation treatments were examined to enhance the textural properties of BP. BP-K (K2CO2 impregnated BP) adsorbents were prepared, and their CO2 adsorption performances were evaluated with CO2 adsorption isotherms, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and 0.1 m 3 chamber (CO2 IR analyzer) at low CO2 level (1000â€“2000 ppm). Through XRD and FT-IR analyses, the adsorption mechanism between K2CO3 and CO2 under moisture-containing indoor air conditions was confirmed to depend on chemisorption in the following reaction pathway: R1â€“R3(K2CO3(s) + H2O (g) + CO2 (g) â‡‹ 2KHCO3(s) (R1), K2CO3(s) + 1Â·.5H2O(g) â‡‹ K2CO3Â·1Â·.5H2O(s) (R2), K2CO3Â·1Â·.5H2O(s) + CO2(g) â‡‹ 2KHCO3(s) + 0Â·.5H2O(g)(R3)).

In this study, the effects of incineration, N2 pyrolysis, and CO2 pyrolysis on the removal of organics and liberation of ternary cathode active materials (CAMs) were compared. The results indicated that the organics in the spent ternary cathode sheets comprised a residual electrolyte and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. Moreover, the organics could be removed to promote the liberation of CAMs via incineration, N2 pyrolysis, and CO2 pyrolysis. When the temperature was <200 Â°C, the chemical properties of the volatilized ester electrolyte remained unchanged during both N2 and CO2 pyrolysis, indicating that the electrolyte can be collected by controlling the pyrolysis temperature and condensation. Furthermore, PVDF binder decomposition occurred at 200â€“600 Â°C. The optimal temperatures of incineration, N2 pyrolysis, and CO2 pyrolysis were 550, 500, and 450 Â°C, respectively, and these treatments increased the liberation efficiency of CAMs from 81.49 % to 98.75 %, 99.26 %, and 97.98 %, respectively. In addition, heat-treated CAMs required less time to achieve adequate liberation. Following three thermal treatment processes, the sizes of the CAM particles were mainly concentrated in the ranges of 0.075â€“0.1 mm and <0.075 mm.

The electrochemical performance of waste LIB-derived LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (W-NCM) cathode active materials was evaluated in half-cell and full-cell configurations and compared with that of a commercial LIB cathode active material of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) used in automobile applications. The Li-ion extraction/insertion specific capacity of W-NCM in the half-cell was 120 mAh/g at 15 mA gâˆ’1, which was 70.4 % that of NCM. The specific capacity of W-NCM in a full-cell using a graphite anode at 0.1 C was 85 mAh/g, which was 69.1 % that of NCM.

At optimal conditions of the roasting temperature of 450 Â°C, the (NH4)2SO4-to-spent xLi2MnO3Â·(1-x)LiMO2 mass ratio of 3:1, and the roasting time of 24 min, the spent xLi2MnO3Â·(1-x)LiMO2 phase was completely destroyed and converted into water-soluble metal-ammine-sulfates and metal-sulfates, resulting in that 99.41% Li, 98.67% Ni, and 98.61% Mn were rapidly extracted. Furthermore, possible conversion mechanisms and the kinetics for the roasting process were both investigated in detail, combined thermodynamics, DSC-TG, macroâ€“micro scale analyses and DFT calculations. Finally, Mn as high-purity MnSO4 products with a purity of 99.98%, and Li and Ni as Li2SO4-NiSO4 mixture products, were efficiently recovered via (NH4)2SO3 precipitation, oxidation leaching, extraction and stripping, and evaporative crystallization. Compared with other current recovery process, this work shows better economic and environmental benefits, while maintaining the considerable Li, Ni, and Mn extraction yields, which is expected for the recycling of spent xLi2MnO3Â·(1-x)LiMO2 cathode materials in the future.",Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries,reduction leaching of LES,"1.4 times the stoichiometric amount of H2SO4, 1.5 times the amount of Fe powder, an L/S ratio of 5 mL/g, and a reaction duration of 150 min at 60 °C",FePO4,60

This necessity arises despite the low commercial value of LES, as conventional recovery methods are cost-prohibitive, leading to insufficient attention to LES recovery. The recent surge in retired batteries has resulted in a significant accumulation of LES, posing serious environmental concerns, however, the high content of Fe and P resources in LES presents a potential value. The study begins with a theoretical analysis, concluding that the reduction leaching of LES is a feasible approach. By integrating this with the Fe powder synthesis route for FePO4, it is found that efficient leaching of LES can be achieved using a low concentration of H2SO4, thereby significantly reducing the recovery cost. This method not only efficiently utilize LES but also alleviates environmental pressure. The thermodynamic analysis sheds light on the mechanism of LES leaching and FePO4 synthesis, confirming the feasibility of each reaction. Optimal leaching conditions (1.4 times the stoichiometric amount of H2SO4, 1.5 times the amount of Fe powder, an L/S ratio of 5 mL/g, and a reaction duration of 150 min at 60 Â°C), under which the leaching rates of Fe and P reached 94.66% and 98.23%, respectively. Additionally, the study introduces a method to remove the main impurity Al in LES, achieving a removal rate of over 99%, reducing its concentration to below 100 ppm. Other impurities, such as Ti, Mn, and Zn, also meet the Chinese Chemical Industry Standard (HG/T 4701-2021). Comparative analyses were conducted between regenerated R-FePO4, commercial Câ€“FePO4, and untreated LES (r-FePO4). LiFePO4 materials derived from these sources were synthesized, followed by an evaluation of their electrochemical performance. The regenerated R-FePO4 matched the quality of commercial FePO4 and significantly outperformed r-FePO4. Additionally, the process proposed in this study yields significant economic benefits, estimating a profit of 719.6 $/t of recycled LES. This research proposes a cost-effective and efficient method for regenerating high-quality battery-grade FePO4 from LES, offering a significant contribution to the closed-loop recycling of waste LiFePO4 batteries.",zinc–carbon and alkaline spent batteries,"chemical analysis, TGA/DTA and X-ray powder diffraction","400°C and 10min, 1000°C and 30min residence time, 1200°C and 30min residence time",manganese and zinc,1200

Separation of the metals has been carried out on the basis of their different boiling points, being 357Â°C and 906Â°C the boiling point of mercury and zinc and 1564Â°C the melting point of Mn2O3. Characterization by chemical analysis, TGA/DTA and X-ray powder diffraction of the mixture has been carried out after comminution sieving and shaking table treatment to remove the anodic collectors and most of chlorides contained in the mixture. The mixture has been roasted at various temperatures and resident times in a flow of air to set the best conditions to remove mercury that were 400Â°C and 10min. After that, the flow of air has been turned into a nitrogen one (inert atmosphere) and the temperatures raised, thus permitting the zinc oxide to be reduced to metallic zinc by the carbon present in the original mixture and recovered after volatilization as a high grade concentrate, while manganese was left in the residue. The recovery and the grade of the two metals, at 1000Â°C and 30min residence time, were 84% and 100% for zinc and 85% and 63% for manganese, respectively. The recovery of zinc increased to 99% with a grade of 97% at 1200Â°C and 30min residence time, while the recovery and grade of manganese were 86% and 87%, respectively, at that temperature.

Two extractants were investigated: D2EHPA and Cyanex 272 in n-dodecane, and the preliminary tests suggested that D2EHPA is more efficient to separate Mn and Zn from the leaching solutions. Under the optimized conditions it is observed that in extraction circuit a recovery >99% of zinc and >95% of manganese is archived. The experimental results suggested that two cross-flow liquidâ€“liquid extraction steps are adequate to extract 100% of Zn and about 95% of Mn while the residual Ni was about 80% of its initial content. The extracted elements are stripped using a 4M sulfuric acid solution and the stripping yields were very high, >99% for Ni and Zn and about 98% for Mn. Finally, a possible process flowsheet to separate Mn and Zn from leach liquor of NiMH spent batteries by solvent extraction is proposed. The process includes two stages of extraction with 20% v/v of D2EHPA in n-dodecane (O/A=1/1, room temperature, 30min of contact, pHâ‰¤2.5) and one stage of stripping with 4M of H2SO4 (O/A=1/0.5, room temperature, 15min of contact).

Recycling LiCoO2 cathodes is critical for stabilizing the Li and Co economy. In this work, a kinetic investigation of a closed-loop oxalate-based process for recovery and separation of Li and Co from LiCoO2 has been developed. Metal extraction from LiCoO2 is a non-catalytic solid-liquid reaction with both solid and aqueous products. To understand the kinetics and identify the rate-limiting mechanism, a combined shrinking core model (cSCM) was used for LiCoO2 digestions. LiCoO2 in the presence of aqueous oxalic acid (H2C2O4) at the optimum concentration of 0.46 M and 100 Â°C results in efficient extraction and separation of Li and Co. Diffusion of H2C2O4 into LiCoO2 occurs through a product layer of cobalt oxalate dihydrate (CoC2O4Â·2H2O) that forms on the surface and this process was identified as rate-limiting. The CoC2O4Â·2H2O was precipitated in a micro-rod morphology when 0.46 M hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was added along with 0.23 M H2C2O4, and the reaction was carried out at a temperature of 55â€“75 Â°C. In this case, the chemical reaction at the LiCoO2 surface was identified as the rate-limiting step. Addition of H2O2 resulted in a 33% reduction in the overall activation energy, a 50% reduction in energy consumption, and a 13% reduction in the cost of reagents.

Huge amount of spent LIBs are generated after their end use. LIBs contain metals, organics and plastics which require proper treatment before disposal. Keeping in view of stringent environmental regulations, limited natural resources and energy crisis, adopting recycling will not only protect the environment and pacify the gap between demand and supply but also conserve the natural resources. Present paper reports a complete process for the recycling of LIBs to recover metals and materials as value added products fulfilling zero waste concept. Initially, the spent LIBs were crushed and beneficiated by wet scrubbing process to separate cathodic material, plastic and metallic fractions. The cathodic material contained 20% Co and 2.4% Li along with other impurities (Mn, Fe, Cu). The cathodic material obtained from different LIBs were homogenized and put to leaching studies to optimize various process parameters viz. effect of leachant concentration, temperature, time, etc. About 97% Co and 99.99% Li were leached using 2â€¯M H2SO4 and 10% H2O2 at room temperature, in 2â€¯h maintaining pulp density 75â€¯g/L.

The aim is to provide a versatile and industrially feasible alternative for liquidâ€“liquid extraction and precipitation for recycling of spent Li-ion batteries. A chelating resin with aminomethylphosphonic acid functional group (LewatitÂ® MDS TP 260) was used in a laboratory-scale multicolumn configuration that combined counter-current and cross-current operations. The process was operated at 60 Â°C with a synthetic leachate with pH 1.8 as the feed. A two-step desorption procedure (1.0 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) followed by 0.4 M potassium oxalate (K2C2O4)) was found to prevent accumulation of strongly bound metals in the resin. 1 M H2SO4 was found sufficient for regeneration. Pure raffinate containing Li, Ni, and Co was successfully separated from impurity metals (Mn, Cu, Al, and Fe). In steady state operation, no loss of ion exchange capacity was observed. The process was optimized experimentally with focus on the effect of fresh feed and eluent flow rates to increase the productivity and improve the recovery rates of the target metals while maintaining a raffinate purity of 100 %. Increasing the amount of leachate processed per switch was found to enhance the recovery of Co, Li and Ni due to the displacement effect. Very high recovery yields (96.97 % for Co, 99.15 % for Ni, and 100 % for Li) were achieved. The laboratory scale unit could process 1.64L(LÂ·h)âˆ’1 of leachate to yield 34.04 g(LÂ·h)âˆ’1 of Li+Ni+Co mixture in the raffinate.

Al was completely removed by slowly adding 1.5 mol/L NaOH until the solution pH reached 4.20 and stabilized for 0.5 h. This process resulted in a limited loss of 11 % for Fe and 5 % for Mn. An oxidative precipitation method was proposed to process the Al-free solution to preparate a pure and easily filterable FePO4 product, which can be used in the production of battery materials. Additionally, the loss of Mn in this process was less than 0.5 %.

In this paper, two methods about using the non-oxidizing inorganic iron salt - Fe2(SO4)3 to recover lithium from LiFePO4 are proposed. The method-1 is theoretical-molar Fe2(SO4)3 (Fe2(SO4)3 : LiFePO4 =1:2) dosage is added and more than 97% of lithium can be leached in just 30 min even under a pretty high solid-liquid ratio of 500 g/L. Spectrophotometry provides the evidence of Fe2+/Fe3+ substitution in the leaching process. In the method-2, the generated Fe2+ originating from LiFePO4 is fully utilized with the addition of H2O2, and the dosage of Fe2(SO4)3 is decreased by two thirds (Fe2(SO4)3 : LiFePO4 =1:6). Several sulphates (CuSO4, NiSO4, MgSO4) are employed to explore the leaching mechanism. All the results reveal that the reaction of Fe3+ substituting Fe2+ has a powerful driving force. In addition, these two leaching processes simultaneously present superior selectivity for the impurities.

Then, Li, Ni, and Co is recovered from the aqueous phase to regenerate the LiNi0.5Co0.5O2 cathode materials using a co-precipitation method.

Here we demonstrate that this precipitation is a phenomenon that depends on both Na+ and SO4 2âˆ’ concentrations and not solely on pH. A two-stage leaching for industrially crushed NiMH waste is performed: The first stage consists of H2SO4 leaching (2 M H2SO4, L/S = 10.4, V = 104 ml, T = 30 Â°C) and the second stage of H2O leaching (V = 100 ml, T = 25 Â°C). Moreover, precipitation experiments are separately performed as a function of added Na2SO4 and H2SO4. During the precipitation, higher than stoichiometric quantities of Na to REE are utilized and this increase in both precipitation reagent concentrations results in an improved double sulfate precipitation efficiency.

After impurity removal, the spent LiFePO4 cathode material was used as raw material under the H2SO4 system, and the pressure oxidation leaching process was adopted to achieve the preferential leaching of lithium. The E-pH diagram of the Feâ€“Pâ€“Alâ€“H2O system can determine the stable region of each element in the recovery process of spent LiFePO4 Li-batteries.

The Fe and P were precipitated and recovered as FePO4Â·2H2O. The kinetic analysis shows that the process of high-pressure acid leaching of spent LiFePO4 materials depends on the surface chemical reaction.

ASR (Automotive Shredder Residue), containing 68% of carbon, was added to the mixture to act as a reductant to metallic Zn of the zinc-bearing phases.

As the lead demand will continue to grow, to provide the necessary lead will require an efficient approach to recycling lead acid batteries. In this paper was performed a mathematical modeling of the process parameters for lead recovery from spent lead-acid batteries. The results of the mathematical modeling compare well with the experimental data. The experimental method applied consists in the solubilisation of the sulfate/oxide paste with sodium hydroxide solutions followed by electrolytic processing for lead recovery.

The current recycling processes based on pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy are not fully sustainable options as they recover only the value metals. By contrast direct recycling that aims in regenerating EOL LIB cathodes without breaking down the active compoundâ€™s crystal structure offers the most sustainable option. In this paper the direct recycling of NMC cathodes is investigated in combination with their upcycling. Upcycling is going to be in growing demand since the first generation NMC 111 cathode chemistries evolve to higher energy/nickel-rich formulations. In this work, the baseline is established for direct recycling of low and high nickel NMC cathodes by analyzing the three key steps of chemical delithiation of pristine NMC cathode material, hydrothermal relithiation (4M LiOH for 4â€¯h at 220â€¯Â°C), and annealing (4â€¯h at 850â€¯Â°C) in order to set the ground for investigating the upcycling of NMC 111 to NMC 622. Upcycling is affected via the co-addition of pre-calculated excess NiSO4 and Li2CO3 salts during annealing, following the hydrothermal relithiation step. Use of NiSO4 that is commonly used as p-CAM provides a lower cost alternative to Ni(OH)2 as Ni source. Characterization revealed the upcycled material to have been endowed with the typical Î±-NaFeO2 layered structure and have surface morphology and composition similar to pristine NMC material.

This study employed a glucose-based DES of choline chloride to recover cobalt, manganese, nickel, and lithium from LIB cathode materials, optimizing temperature and time parameters in the range of 60â€“110 Â°C and 2â€“24 h for leaching the cathode materials. The highest metal recoveries were observed between 60 and 110 Â°C, with 82.4% for Ni, 94.2% for Co, 97.6% for Ni, and 93.7% for Li after 24 h of leaching at 100 Â°C. The Co, Mn, Ni, and Li recoveries in the DES solution increased with time at 100 Â°C. UVâ€“visible spectroscopy analysis investigated the leaching mechanisms for cathode metals, confirming that the spent LIBs leaching in DES (ChCl:G) is not completely associated with the reduction of cobalt. It appears that other metal ions, such as Li, Mn, and Ni, form complexes with chloride ions originating from the choline chloride agent. The results of the MD simulation show that hydrogen of the OH in choline chloride has a very strong attractive interaction with the Clâˆ’ ion. Also, H atoms of OH groups in glucose molecules interact considerably with the chloride ion of choline chloride. In addition, all H atoms of OH groups in glucose form hydrogen bonds with O5 of the glucose. All metal ions, including Co3+, Li+, Mn2+, and Ni2+, have very strong electrostatic interactions with the Clâˆ’ of the choline chloride molecule. The MD calculations show that metal ions are complexed with some oxygen atoms of the glucose molecule. Results show that the choline chloride molecule (via Clâˆ’ ion) and glucose molecule (via oxygen atoms) play a significant role in the leaching of metal ions from LIBs via electronegative atoms.

Hydrometallurgical derived full-component separation strategy has been verified as the most capable recycling process for LiFePO4 cathode. During which, complete elements (i.e., Li, Fe and P) are dissolved into a solution of excessive acidic leachate, and subsequently separated to obtain battery-grade FePO4Â·2H2O and lithium salt, enabling high element recovery rates of up to 100 %. However, the use of excessive leaching agent leads to high acidity of the leaching solution (pH < 0.8), which brings a necessary of pH regulation prior to the regeneration of FePO4Â·2H2O, markedly complicating the succedent separation and purification. In this investigation, a practical method for directly regenerating FePO4Â·2H2O from H2SO4-based full-component leaching solution is proposed. In this process, H2SO4 as leaching agent is used to digest LiFePO4 completely, and then Fe and P are premeditatedly recovered from the extremely acidic filtrate (pH < 0.8) as FePO4Â·2H2O via direct precipitation without any pH regulator. Consequently, there are no extra impurities affecting the recovery of Fe and P during regeneration. The regeneration behavior of FePO4Â·2H2O under extremely acidic condition are investigated and the growth mechanism is also clarified by monitoring the overall microstructure and phase evolutions. The results demonstrate that the above regeneration is found to be an exponential growth process driven by the quantity of nucleation site, and meanwhile influenced by the dissolution-reprecipitation equilibrium of amorphous iron phosphate. Specifically, the process can be accelerated by introducing FePO4Â·2H2O or amorphous iron phosphate to increase the nucleation sites. Additionally, the primary nanosheet size of regenerated FePO4Â·2H2O causes a smaller primary particle size of the corresponding LiFePO4/C material, contributing to its better physical and electrochemical properties.

Leaching of the samples without the thermal treatment was done to determine the reference leaching conditions, which were established to be 0.5 M H2SO4 at 25 Â°C for 60 min. Subsequently, samples which had been thermally treated were leached using the aforementioned reference conditions. The effect of thermal treatment on the leaching of Mn and Zn was studied to determine which conditions may improve or hinder subsequent hydrometallurgical processing of alkaline batteries. The use of O2 during the thermal treatment led to formation of ZnMn2O4, which inhibited effective leaching. ZnMn2O4 was decomposed in N2 atmosphere and in the presence of C, improving further dissolution of Mn. The use of H2 led to formation of Mn3O4. This compound showed low dissolution, being possible to be separated from impurities such as Fe, Ni and K by leaching with 0.5 M H2SO4. To increase the purity of recovered Mn3O4, oxalic acid was used as reduction agent. A final solid product, Mn3O4, with a purity of 99.95%, was obtained. Data provided by this research can lead to improvements of existing recycling processes, allowing for higher leaching efficiency of alkaline and ZnC battery materials. Also, overall material recovery rates can be increased by producing manganese oxide with high purity.",Lead Acid Battery,pyrometallurgical process,"600 Â°C, 1200 Â°C, 300 Â°C","lead, battery sludge",600

However, LiFePO4 cannot be reduced by carbon because of its thermodynamically stable olivine structure. Herein, LiFePO4 is converted to Fe and lithium salts by carbon with the assistance of Na2CO3 that acts as an activating agent to break down the chemical bonds of LiFePO4 and thereby enable the carbothermic reduction. Using Na2CO3 as the activating agent, LiFePO4 was reduced to Fe, NaLi2PO4, and LiNa5(PO4)2 which can be separated by magnetic separation with a Li recovery rate of 99.2%. Using NaOH as the activating agent, LiFePO4 was oxidized to Fe3O4, NaLi2PO4 and LiNa5(PO4)2 at 600 Â°C, and the roasted products can be separated by magnetic separation process with a Li recovery rate of 92.7%. Various sodium salts were tested to screen proper salts for the reduction process, and a 400-g scale roasting-separation process has been demonstrated.

Li-based metal oxide and graphite were efficiently separated from their respective foils and used for lixiviation. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) and water were used as lixiviants for the recovery of metals from cathode and anode materials respectively. It was found that with 3â€¯M Acetic acid and 7.5â€¯vol% H2O2 as reducing agent 99.9% Li, 98.7% Co, and 99.5% Mn were leached out from cathode material in 40â€¯min at 70â€¯Â°C and a pulp density of 20â€¯g/L. Besides the cathode leaching, Li was also extracted from anodic material graphite using water as a solvent and further recovered as solid Li2CO3 (99.7% Li). The kinetic evaluation of the cathode lixiviate process was studied using three different shrinking-core kinetic Models and established that the reaction follows the product layer diffusion controlled mechanism. From the cathode leach liquor, 99% Co was recovered as metal sulfide by controlled sulfide precipitation with 99.2% purity, and subsequently, MnCO3 and Li2CO3 were obtained with the purity of 98.7% and 99.4%, respectively.

Two leaching agents â€” H2SO4 and HCl were used in order to compare their effects on cobalt and lithium extraction. It follows from the results that using HCl as a leaching reagent is more appropriate than using H2SO4. Optimal conditions for cobalt and lithium recovery were: 2M HCl, 60â€“80Â°C, leaching time 90min. The work also explains the influence of temperature on cobalt and lithium extraction from active mass by activation energy in case of both leaching agents. It was found that the cobalt extraction in sulfuric acid occurs in two time periods. In the first time period, in 15 to 20min from the beginning of leaching, the process is controlled by the rate of a chemical reaction (Ea(Co)=43â€“48kJÂ·molâˆ’1). In second time period, the process changes to diffusion controlled, as it is evidenced from the value of Ea(Co)=3â€“3.5kJÂ·molâˆ’1. In the case of HCl, cobalt extraction in first time period is controlled by the rate of chemical reaction, Ea(Co)=40â€“44kJÂ·molâˆ’1. In the second time period, process is converted to a mixed mechanism, Ea(Co)=20â€“26kJÂ·molâˆ’1. Lithium extraction is controlled by the diffusion in both of time periods, or occurs in mixed mode.

This study provides a strategy for the high-value utilization of waste anode materials. Two kinds of catalysts containing different graphite C content were prepared by a calcination process using the anode material of spent lithium-ion batteries. The synthesized AM (AM-450/AM-850) catalysts were applied to activate peroxymonosulfate and degrade ciprofloxacin in water. The AM catalysts consist of CuO and graphite C, which can effectively activate peroxymonosulfate. Under optimal conditions (ciprofloxacin = 10 mg/L; catalyst = 0.4 g/L; [peroxymonosulfate] = 1.0 mM), the degradation efficiencies of AM-450 and AM-850 for ciprofloxacin were 90% and 84% separately within 60 min. Both radical pathways (SO4 Â·âˆ’, HOÂ· and Â·O2 âˆ’) and non-radical pathways (1O2, surface electron transfer) participated in the degradation of ciprofloxacin in AM-450/PMS and AM-850/PMS systems with a noticeable difference. The surface electron transfer non-radical channel was the main channel for ciprofloxacin degradation in AM-450/PMS, while the radical degradation channel played a crucial role in AM-850/PMS system.

For this purpose, roasting technology along with MNBs was applied to overcome the challenge of poor efficiency of electrode active materials flotation. The roasting properties (temperature: 300â€“500 Â°C and time: 1 h) and corresponding surface alterations of the electrode active materials (zeta potential, contact angle, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) were analyzed to explore the surface properties of roasting materials in the presence of MNBs. MNB-assisted flotation was employed to effectively separate the cathode active materials (CMs) from anode active materials (AMs). Results showed that the efficiency of electrode materials flotation without the roasting process was low due to the existence of residual organic binders and electrolytes. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), XPS and zeta potential analyses showed that the electrolyte residuals and organic binders were eliminated following roasting at 400 Â°C for 1 h. After roasting, the zeta potential of the CMs and AMs increased from âˆ’55 Â± 2 to âˆ’26 Â± 1 mV and âˆ’46 Â± 1 to âˆ’30 Â± 1 mV, respectively. These improvements indicated that CM surfaces were more hydrophilic, while the AM surfaces were more hydrophobic. In the presence of MNBs, contact angle measurements showed the highest and lowest values of 91 Â± 1Â° and 29 Â± 1Â° for the AMs and CMs, respectively at 400 Â°C. It was found that the flotation performance was improved after the roasting process and in the presence of MNBs and relatively lower reagent consumption (50%) was required to obtain higher recovery.

Two physical pretreatments were performed at pilot scale in order to recover electrodic powders: the first including crushing, milling, and sieving and the second granulation, and sieving. Recovery yield of electrodic powder was significantly influenced by the type of pretreatment. About 50% of initial LIB wastes was recovered by the first treatment (as electrodic powder with size <0.5mm, Sample 1), while only 37% of powder with size <1mm (Sample 2) can be recovered by the second treatment. Chemical digestion put in evidence the heterogeneity of recovered powders denoting different amounts of Co, Mn, and Ni. Leaching tests of both powders were performed in order to determine optimized conditions for metal extraction. Solid/liquid ratios and sulfuric acid concentrations were changed according to factorial designs at constant temperature (80Â°C). Optimized conditions for quantitative extraction (>99%) of Co and Li from Sample 1 are 1/10g/mL as solid/liquid ratio and +50% stoichiometric excess of acid (1.1M).

This paper presents a promising approach for recovering lithium from low lithium high-salt solution which is usually produced in the spent LIBs recycling process. The solution was firstly purified, and then lithium was precipitated by phosphate, the effects of operating conditions on the Li3PO4 precipitation behaviors were evaluated. The results indicated that temperature is a more important factor than seed crystal or flocculant. After that, Li3PO4 was dissolved by acid as the anolyte, and electrodialysis with cation-exchange membranes was used to investigate the separation performance of Li and P. The results showed that Li and P was effectively separated by electrodialysis, and the P/Li mass ratio of the catholyte was reduced to 0.23 (6.5 times lower compared to a feed P/Li ratio of 1.48). Deep separation of lithium and phosphorus in the catholyte was achieved by raising pH to make the lithium precipitated with the permeated phosphorus.

FTIR and XPS analyses show the main contributions of amine and sulfonic groups in the binding mechanism. Maximum sorption capacity reaches 20 mmol Li gâˆ’1, and the sorption isotherms are fitted by the Langmuir Dual Site equation; the process being spontaneous, exothermic and enthalpy-driven. The sorption remains highly efficient in 1 M NaCl solution, while the uptake remains strongly selective in the presence of equimolar concentrations of alkali-earth and heavy elements (Fe > Zn > Mg > Ca > Ni > Al cations). This selectivity (SCLi/Metal varying between 14 and 36) is controlled by the pH (optimum close to 2.2) and slightly increases (up to 16â€“69) with adding oxalic acid (1% w/w). The equilibrium is achieved, under selected experimental conditions, within 30â€“90 min of contact (depending on temperature). Uptake kinetics are fitted by the pseudo-first order rate equation, though the contribution of resistance to intraparticle diffusion cannot be neglected. Bound metal can be completely desorbed using hydrochloric acid solution (0.2 M); the kinetics of desorption is fast (within 20 to 30 min). Both sorption and desorption performances are remarkably stable for 18 cycles (loss in sorption less than 10.4% at the 18th cycle).

Therefore, recycling Co from the spent Co-enriched materials is indispensable. Co-based perovskites, which contain abundant Co, are extensively utilized in solid oxide fuel cells, three-way catalysts, and oxygen-permeable membranes, and the recovery of Co from the spent Co-based perovskites is necessary to meet the long-term requirement of Co. In this work, a facile and universal thermal reduction method (750 Â°C and N2 atmosphere) is employed to convert the spent cobalt-based perovskites into high-performance bifunctional oxygen catalysts for zinc-air batteries (ZABs), achieving high-efficient Co recovery and re-utilization. At high temperatures, melamine and dopamine hydrochloride are transformed into carbon nanotubes, C3N4 and reducing gases (such as NH3 and H2). Simultaneously, the metal elements in the spent Co-based perovskites (SrNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3,SNCF) are converted into nano-scale alloy particles and metal nitrides. Then, the phase structures, micromorphology, and element valences of the obtained multiphase oxygen catalyst (SNCFâ€“Ni-PM) are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning/transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. The electrochemical properties, including oxygen catalytic activities and stability, of SNCF-Ni-PM are measured by linear sweep voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, chronoamperometry, and cyclic voltammetry methods. Considering the practical applications, the aqueous and solid-state ZABs are assembled and measured. The results demonstrate that the multiphase SNCF-Ni-PM mainly includes carbon nanotubes, C3N4 nanosheets, and FeNiN or CoFe nanoparticles.

Owed to a lack of apt technology, approx. 25% of this lithium is disposed of as lithium foil punching residues and is not recycled. The non-uniform lithium metal waste qualities, the high hazard potential when handling metallic lithium as well as the intake of impurities through the processing procedure are the main reasons why lithium from this source has not been recycled, yet.

The mesoporous carbon was synthesized by the replica method using silica gel as a template and exhibited a high surface area with an accessible pore volume due to mesopores (Vmeso > 95%). Fast kinetics and high sorption capacities of these metals were achieved with the chemical activation of mesoporous carbons. The surface modification of the mesoporous carbon was carried out by physical activation with O2 at 450 Â°C and chemical activation under mild conditions (room temperatures) with NaClO2/H2O2 as oxidizing agents. FTIR analysis and conductimetric titration showed that the combination of an initial physical activation step, followed by chemical functionalization, maximized the formation of carboxylic acids (from 0.2 to 0.9 meq/g), due to the complete oxidation of the weakly acidic groups.

This carbon stood out amongst the others studied (2 to 11-fold increase in sorption capacities depending on the metal) and was tested in multimetallic solutions, showing fast removal rates, reaching equilibrium within the first 15 min, as well as selectivity towards divalent cations (18 mg/g of Co2+) with insignificant lithium sorption (qLi = 0.33 mg/g).

There were challenges in recovering high-purity FePO4 from wastewater with complex components, especially in achieving large-scale recovery. Here, a pilot-scale platform, the Chemical Enhanced Primary Treatment (CEPT) coupled Fe@aminated-polyacrylonitrile (Fe-NH2-PAN) adsorption, was established for recovering battery-grade FePO4 from biogas slurry. The platform stably removed over 80% of PO4 3âˆ’ from biogas slurry during long-term operation, the removed PO4 3âˆ’ was enriched in chemical sludge and Fe-NH2-PAN, and then was leached into H2SO4 solution.

The cathodic part of LIBs, which are mainly composed of Li, Al and Co, sourced from electronic waste (e-waste) was first subjected to a suspension stage for removing Al. XRD analysis of the cathodic sample free of Al (C1) revealed that C1 was in the form of LiCoO2. Thermal behavior of C1 was also examined against time and temperature using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Thermal isolation of C1 was carried out via reduction in argon atmosphere using activated carbon at temperature in the range of 600 Â°C to 800 Â°C for 30 min. At 600 Â°C, no dissociation of the initial compound of LiCoO2 was observed. At 800 Â°C Li totally liberated from the sample in form of gas and cobalt oxide was reduced to the metallic cobalt. However, at 700 Â°C, Li was thermally isolated in form of solid lithium carbonate and separated from Co. Temperature of 700 Â°C was selected as the optimum temperature for thermal isolation of Li which resulted in dissociation of LiCoO2 into Co, CoO and Li2CO3. After thermal isolation at 700 Â°C, the resulting mixture (C2) was dispersed into distilled water, placed in a cold-water bath with temperature of 0 Â°C and was allowed to gradually dissolve in water for 1 h. After filtration and washing using a centrifuge, the solution was subjected to ICP analysis and the undissolved particles were dried in an oven overnight prior to further reduction at 700 Â°C for full reduction of cobalt oxide to metallic cobalt.

Less solvent solid state reaction (LSR) is reactions of solids with the help of a little solvent, which has advantage of almost 100% conversion of reactants and no waste generation. Herein, LFP (S-LFP) from spent batteries was first entirely decomposed to produce FePO4 and LiH2PO4 in H3PO4-H2O2 leaching systems using the LSR method. Then, battery-grade Li2CO3 was prepared by adding CaCl2 and Na2CO3 to LiH2PO4.

It performs well on high energy density and thermal stability, but after several charged-discharged cycles, its capacity significantly degrades and becomes waste. Leaching methods with strong inorganic acids are widely used to prevent the release of valuable metals into the environment. Still, these methods must be effectively achieved regarding the low selectivity of specific metals and environmental emissions.

In this context, a novel process is developed to realize the recovery of spent LiMn2O4 lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) via one-step pyrolysis and reductant-free acid leaching. The leaching efficiencies of lithium and manganese are respectively 99.9% and 99.4% under the optimal pyrolysis conditions: a temperature of 500 Â°C, a nitrogen flow rate of 50 mL/min, and a pyrolysis time of 60 min.

In this study, a green and facile process for recovery of valuable metals from spent LIBs by waste copperas was proposed. The effects of heat treatment parameters on recovery efficiency of valuable metals and the redox mechanism were studied systematically through phase transformation behavior and valence transition. At low temperature (â‰¤460 Â°C), copperas reacted with lithium on the outer layer of LIBs preferentially, but the reduction of transition metals was limited. As the temperature rose to 460â€“700 Â°C, the extraction efficiency of valuable metals was greatly enhanced due to the generation of SO2, and the gasâ€“solid reaction proceeded much fast than the solidâ€“solid reaction. In the final stage (â‰¥700 Â°C), the main reactions were the thermal decomposition of soluble sulfates and the combination of decomposed oxides with Fe2O3 to form insoluble spinel.

The addition of Acorga M5640 to the Ionquest 801 organic solution generated a significant pH isotherm shift for copper with a Î”pH50 value of 3.45. As a result, the separation of iron(III), copper and aluminium from cobalt, nickel and lithium could easily be realised with the mixed extractant system. The McCabeâ€“Thiele diagrams at an A/O ratio of 2:1 and pH 4.0 showed that three theoretical stages are needed for the extraction of iron, copper and aluminium. The extraction kinetics of iron(III) and copper was rapid, but the extraction kinetics of aluminium was slow. With the increase of temperature from room temperature to 40Â°C, the aluminium extraction kinetics increased substantially. It is therefore recommended that the metal extraction should be carried out at 40Â°C. The stripping kinetics of aluminium and copper was rapid, but iron cannot be stripped effectively.

Subsequently, battery-grade manganese sulfate was successfully prepared from the pure MnSO4 solution by evaporation - crystallization. In this study, the introduction of cationic impurities such as Na+ and NH4 + was avoided during Li-Mn separation and acid-leachate purification through the selection of suitable neutralizer and sulfide precipitant.

This need will only be exasperated in the future as personal electronic equipment and electric vehicles (EV) become more widespread. In this study, a simple process for the separation of the cathode materials from waste Apple iPhone 6 lithium batteries is proposed, consisting of thermal treatment followed by ultrasonication. The main advantages of the process are its simplicity and complete independence from all chemicals. Heating the cathode material to 550Â°C gradually increases the removal efficiency; however, further increase in temperature results in a sharp decline of removal due to changes in the Al foil structure. With limited aeration inside the muffle furnace the removal barely exceeded 60%, whereas under suitable aeration, removal efficiencies exceeding 90% were obtained. Ultrasonication aids the release of cathode powder by creating convective flow as well as intense cavitation. As ultrasonication time and power increase, so does the removal efficiency. However, by increasing the power from 50 W to 100 W, the cathode powder separation efficiency decreases. This is because the numerous cavitation bubbles create a barrier for the transmission of acoustic energy to other parts of the tank, meaning the physical vibration of the transducer is greater than the fluid's ability to stay in contact. The final obtained cathodic powder under optimum conditions (heating for 15 min at 550Â°C, followed by ultrasonic treatment at 45Â°C and 50 Watts for 1 min) was 45.5% Co, 4.9% Al, 13.7% Cu, 3.6% Li, and 13.7% Ni.",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),Thermal treatment followed by ultrasonication,"550Â°C, 15 min, 45Â°C, 50 Watts",cathodic powder,550

The initial pH and the loading ratios of LiCoO2 both significantly influenced the leaching efficiencies of Li and Co in MFC-A. Approximately 45% Li and 93% Co were simultaneously released through the reduction of LiCoO2 at the initial pH of 1 and the loading ratios of LiCoO2 of 0.2 g/L.

One of the difficulties for effective metal recovery is the separation of different metals from the solution after leaching. In this research, a full hydrometallurgical process is developed to selectively recover valuable metals (Ni, Co and Li) from cathode scrap of spent lithium ion batteries. By introducing ammonia-ammonium sulphate as the leaching solution and sodium sulphite as the reductant, the total selectivity of Ni, Co and Li in the first-step leaching solution is more than 98.6% while it for Mn is only 1.36%. In detail understanding of the selective leaching process is carried out by investigating the effects of parameters such as leaching reagent composition, leaching time (0â€“480min), agitation speed (200â€“700rpm), pulp density (10â€“50g/L) and temperature (323â€“353K). It was found that Mn is primarily reduced from Mn4+ into Mn2+ into the solution as Mn ( NH 3 ) x 2 + while it subsequently precipitates out into the residue in the form of (NH4)2Mn(SO3)2Â·H2O. Ni, Co and Li are leached and remain in the solution either as metallic ion or amine complexes.

The sulfation reactions are thermodynamically spontaneous, and the rate of roasting is governed by the operating temperature. A temperature higher than 300 Â°C is required to enable the rapid roasting kinetics associated with the assistance of liquid phases. At last, a closed-loop recycling approach is approved by the excellent electrochemical performances of the regenerated NCM622 prepared by recovered sulfates.

Herein, a low-temperature roasting process followed by a water leaching strategy is developed to recycle and regenerate LiCoO2 cathode material from spent LiCoO2 batteries. The spent LiCoO2 is roasted with glucose (C6H12O6) as a reagent to attain reduction of the cathode material into water-soluble Li salt (Li2O and Li2CO3) and water-insoluble (Co and CoO).

This is causing an accumulation of production scrap which must be treated to allow re-utilization of cathode material in production. Several industrial lithium battery recycling processes use thermal pre-treatment in an oxidative or inert atmosphere, or in a vacuum, to separate the battery components and remove organic material. However, a comparison of the effects of incineration, dynamic pyrolysis (under a constant flow of inert gas), and pyrolysis under vacuum on the microstructure and composition of scrap cathode material has not been explored.

The purpose of this article is to study a new method, microwave pyrolysis of the shells of macadamia nuts, for efficient recycling of lithium from spent lithium-ion batteries. XRD, SEM, and TGA analyses were used to observe the phase change during roasting. With the help of microwave heating and biomass pyrolysis, the decomposition temperature of Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2 was reduced to 300â€¯Â°C. Carbonated water-soluble Li2CO3 was formed under the action of biochar. Accordingly, the effects of pyrolysis temperature (Pte), biomass dose (bio%), reduction roasting temperature (Rte) and reduction roasting time (Rti) on the leaching rate of lithium were studied, and the results indicated that 93.4% lithium could be leached under the following optimum conditions: bio%â€¯=â€¯24, Pteâ€¯=â€¯500â€¯Â°C, Rteâ€¯=â€¯750â€¯Â°C, and Rtiâ€¯=â€¯25â€¯min.

Despite significant research, it is still difficult to efficiently recycle valuable and hazardous metals from waste Niâ€“Cd batteries in an economical and environmentally friendly manner. This study employed a novel process utilizing ultrasound-assisted leaching to recover Ni, Cd, and Co from waste nickel-cadmium (Niâ€“Cd) batteries. Organic DL-malic acid served as the leaching agent and H2O2 was employed as an oxidizing agent. The effects of various factors on the recovery efficiency of Ni, Cd, and Co, such as leaching temperature, time, DL-malic acid concentration, pulp density, H2O2 concentration, and ultrasound frequency, were also examined. To predict the chemical compounds present before and after the recycling experiments, the solid residues from the metal extraction were analyzed using XRD, XPS, FE-SEM, and EDS element mapping. Concurrently, ICP-OES was utilized to determine the metal content in the leachate. Under optimized conditions of 90 Â°C, 90 min, 2M DL-malic acid, 160 mL/g pulp density, and 20% ultrasound frequency, over 83% of Ni, 94% of Cd, and 98% of Co were effectively leached from the waste Niâ€“Cd battery powder. The leaching kinetics of Ni, Cd, and Co followed the surface chemical reaction control model. The activation energies (Ea) for Ni, Cd, and Co leaching were 21.34, 20.47, and 18.38 kJ/mol, respectively.

164,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.143756,A novel process for recovering LNCM battery cathode material using cryolite-based electrolyte through selective dissolution - acid leaching - coprecipitation,"Around the world the number of scrapped lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which are rich in valuable elements worthy of recycling, is increasing. In this study, a method using cryolite-based electrolyte to recycle cathode materials from spent lithium nickel-cobalt-manganese oxide (LNCM) batteries is proposed. Firstly, a molten cryolite-based electrolyte is used to decompose the microstructure of spent LIB cathode material, releasing valuable lithium element into the electrolyte, which can be used in aluminum electrolysis industry. As nickel-cobalt-manganese oxides have low solubilities in the cryolite-based electrolyte, they sink to the bottom of the molten electrolyte, which is then cooled down, forming an upper and lower layer. Lithium element can be quickly and conveniently separated from nickel-cobalt-manganese oxides, which are enriched in the lower layer of the electrolyte. Then, a hydrochloric acid solution is used to leach nickel-cobalt-manganese components from the lower layer of the cryolite-based electrolyte. The effects of acid concentration, liquid-solid ratio, and temperature on the leaching process are investigated through single factor experiments. The highest leaching rates of nickel, cobalt, and manganese elements reach 99.47%, 98.94%, and 98.27%, respectively. By using NaOH + NH3Â·H2O to adjust the pH of the leaching solution, coprecipitation of nickel, cobalt, and manganese elements occur, producing a hydroxide precursor and resulting in recovery rates of over 99%. The recycled hydroxide precursor and new lithium source are then roasted to regenerate an LNCM811 cathode material, which has a layered microstructure and is assembled into a battery.

Recovery of lithium from spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is significant for addressing lithium shortage and environmental issues. Sulfation roasting is often accused of being unsustainable and not environmentally friendly due to the consumption of expensive sulfation reagents and emission of SO2. Herein, a novel and green recycling process for selective separation of lithium from spent LiMn2O4 (LMO) batteries was proposed based on a SO2 emission free sulfation roasting with waste copperas. Lithium in the cathode power were selectively sulfated into soluble Li2SO4 with a conversion of 99.50%, while manganese was riched as insoluble oxides. At low temperature (e.g. 400 Â°C), LMO were difficult to be sulfated due to the limited sulfation ability of SO4 2- and mass transfer. When the roasting temperature reached 700 Â°C, SO2 was produced and the generated SO2 reacted in situ with the LMO to form Li2SO4 and MnSO4, preventing SO2 emissions into the atmosphere. As temperature continued to increase, the MnSO4 acted as a sulfation reagent and sulfated the unreacted LMO.

The effects of sulfur (S0) and ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4.7H2O) were investigated on cobalt, nickel and lithium bioleaching mechanisms. The results showed that increasing sulfur concentration improves lithium recovery; while it has no effect on cobalt and nickel dissolution. On the other hand, FeSO4.7H2O increased cobalt recovery and its leaching kinetic significantly. Fe2+ increased cobalt recovery by acting as reducing agent. Just within 2 days of bioleaching with 24.25 g/l FeSO4.7H2O, the Co, Ni and Li recoveries reached 99.9%, 99.7% and 84%.

With the rapid development of portable electronics, more than 100,000 tons of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are produced every year. Conventional battery recycling processes including pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes mainly aim at extracting valuable metallic components from spent LIB cathodes, which requires high temperature reduction and/or acid/alkali chemicals to destroy covalent bond in cathodes and convert them into atoms for further extraction. The former leads to high energy consumption and the latter produces a lot of wastewater, which not only increases cost, but also damages our environment. Moreover, traditional recycling starts from spent battery cathodes and ends up with lithium/cobalt salts, which is unsustainable. Herein, a different recycling strategy to directly convert degraded LiCoO2 into high-voltage LiCoO2 cathode materials was proposed, featuring a closed-loop and green procedure.

In this study, a sealed stainless-steel reactor was selected to achieve CO2-assisted low-temperature thermal reduction of spent LiCoO2 by carbon at 500 Â°C. The thermal reduction was provoked by the in-situ generated CO that resulted from the reaction of carbon and CO2. More importantly, MgCO3 was used as a CO2 holder to provide CO2 at elevated temperatures and MgO can be used to absorb CO2 to regenerate MgCO3, enabling the CO2 as a clean additive in the reduction reaction. Using this low-temperature reduction coupled with the carbonate pyrolysis approach, the selective recovery of Li reached 94.21%. The spatial isolation of MgCO3 at the bottom layer, graphite at the middle layer, and LiCoO2 at the top layer in the same reactor avoids complex separation. In addition, LiCoO2 is directly regenerated by the obtained CoO/Co3O4 and Li2CO3, and regenerated LiCoO2 exhibits good electrochemical performance with a discharge capacity retention of 94.0% after 300 cycles.

Nevertheless, among various types of discarded lithium battery electrode materials, limited research has been conducted on the recycling of ternary electrode materials (LiNi x Co y Mn1-x-y O2). This study proposes an eco-friendly process for the efficient recovery of valuable metals and carbon from mixed materials of discarded ternary lithium-ion battery electrodes. This study investigated the influence of various roasting using ammonium sulfate and leaching conditions on the conversion and extraction rates of valuable metals. Under the condition of a 3:1 mass ratio of ammonium sulfate to lithium battery electrode mixed material, roasting temperature of 450 Â°C, roasting time of 30 min, liquid-solid ratio of 20:1, leaching time of 20 min, and leaching temperature of 60 Â°C, the recovery rates of various valuable metals including Li, Ni, Co, and Mn reached 99.99%. For the above process, the chemical control reaction prevailed in the initial 10 min of the roasting reaction, succeeded by the dominance of diffusion control reaction in the subsequent 20 min. In the leaching process, the chemical control reaction governed the first 2 min, succeeded by diffusion control reaction for the next 18 min. Analysis of the reaction's macroscopic and microscopic mechanisms reveals that ammonium sulfate roasting of waste ternary lithium-ion batteries constitutes a typical liquid-solid reaction. In the molten state, NH4 + decomposition releases high-energy H+ ions that break the bonds between metals and oxygen. Consequently, metal atoms from the waste battery's crystal structure combine with ammonium sulfate's sulfate groups, forming various metal sulfates.

Recovery of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with remarkable resource and pollution characteristics is an essential solution to alleviate the shortage of lithium resources and drive the sustainable industrial development. Herein, a novel strategy was proposed as chemical looping complementary reduction (CLCR) for recycling valuable metals from spent LiCoO2 battery as chemical-looping cyclic carriers. The influencing factors of reduction temperature, time and H2 flows on reduction characteristics of LiCoO2 carriers were investigated on a laboratory-scale fixed bed. The results indicated that both high temperature and elevated H2 flows were conduce to enhancing LiCoO2 conversion with fairly high crystallinity and purity of reduction products (mainly Li2O and Co monomers) and 98.36 % conversion of LiCoO2 was attained at 1000 Â°C for 120 min with the H2 flow of 60 mL/min. Thermodynamic analysis proved that complementary matching properties existed between reduction temperature and H2 concentration affecting the phase equilibrium of products, while 650 Â°C âˆ¼ 900 Â°C was favorable to obviate the formation of liquid LiOH and the loss of target products.

Three mechanical routes of treatment were developed for each type recovering mainly three fractions: ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals and electrodic powders. The above mentioned types of spent batteries were also treated together by a unique mechanical route, obtaining in this way a powder enriched in cobalt, nickel and manganese which can be further extractable by chemical leaching. Experimental tests of solvent extraction were performed on synthetic leach liquors simulating a feed mixture of spent devices with weight composition 40% NiMH, 40% primary lithium, and 20% Li-ion (as determined by manual sorting of 3 tons of end of life batteries collected in Northern Italy). Under these conditions nickel and cobalt can be easily separated by using Cyanex 272 (stoichiometric ratio Cyanex/Co = 4, pH 5â€“6), but in presence of manganese Cyanex 272 loses its selectivity towards cobalt.

In this study, a novel approach for recycling valuable metals from spent LiCoO2 batteries via co-pyrolysis with three different carbonaceous materials (waste polyethylene, biomass, and coal)) was proposed and evaluated. The thermodynamic analysis proved that carbonaceous materials (mainly carbon) were theoretically able to facilitate the decomposition process of LiCoO2. The promotion effect on LiCoO2 decomposition was in the following order: coal > biomass > polyethylene, and the decomposition temperature of LiCoO2 could significantly reduce by 400 Â°C via adding coal. The char produced from the carbonaceous materials, rather than the volatiles, played an important role in LiCoO2 decomposition and reduction. The pyrolysis products of LiCoO2 and coal mixture exhibited typical superparamagnetism and hysteresis behaviours, which benefitted the subsequent magnetic separation. The recovery rates of Co and Li were sensitive to the pyrolysis temperature and residence time, respectively. A high proportion of Co was in the form of CoO below 800 Â°C and had not been completely reduced, leading to the relatively lower recovery rates of Co below 800 Â°C. The optimal recovery rates of Co (96.8%) and Li (88.7%) were obtained at the pyrolysis temperature of 800 Â°C and the residence time of 10 min.

Given the current overall lithium recovery rate in LiFePO4 batteries is below 1 %, there is a compelling demand for an eco-friendly, cost-efficient, and sustainable solution. This study introduces a green and sustainable recycling method that employs environmentally benign formic acid and readily available oxygen as reaction agents for selectively leaching lithium from discarded lithium iron phosphate powder. Formic acid was employed as the leaching agent, and oxygen served as the oxidizing agent. Utilizing a single-factor variable approach, various factors including formic acid concentration, oxygen flow rate, leaching time, liquid-to-solid ratio, and reaction temperature were individually investigated. Moreover, the feasibility of this method was explored mechanistically by analyzing E-pH diagrams of the Li-Fe-P-H2O system. Results demonstrate that under conditions of 2.5 mol/L formic acid concentration, 0.12 L/min oxygen flow rate, 25 mL/g liquid-to-solid ratio, 70 Â°C reaction temperature, and 3 h reaction time, lithium leaching efficiency exceeds 99.9 %, with iron leaching efficiency only at 1.7 %. Moreover, we also explored using air instead of oxygen as the oxidant and get the excellent lithium leaching rate (97.81 %) and low iron leaching rate (4.81 %), which shows the outstanding selectivity. Furthermore, the environmentally benign composition of the chemical reagents, comprising only C, H, and O elements, establishes it as a genuinely green and sustainable technology for secondary resource recovery.

The synthesis of carbon nanomaterials from conversion of waste polymers is an alternative, promising approach owing to the high added-value of these products. In particular, novel carbon materials, could translate into interesting and cheap material for the catalytic reduction of oxygen (ORR), a fundamental reaction for the production of H2O2 or in fuel cell and metal air batteries. This paper presents the synthesis of iron-nitrogen-carbon (Fe-N-C) electrocatalysts starting from a mix of polyethylene (PE) and polyurethane (PU) by adding FeCl3 as an iron source for promoting Fe-Nx sites formation. The two polymers were mixed according to a solvent assisted process employing p-xylene or with a solvent free process using a Brabender plastograph. The blend of thermoplastic and thermoset polymers was converted into Fe-N-C materials in a two-step pyrolysis, where the temperature of second pyrolysis showed to sensitively affect the chemical and textural properties of the resulting material. Depending on the temperature, and initial PE content, the surface area ranges between 195 and 479 m2 gâˆ’1, with a preferential formation of micropores.

To solve this issue, MnO2 with different crystalline phases were prepared as catalysts (recovered from spent lithium-ion battery cathode materials) for the degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ) in this study by acid leaching and hydrothermal methods, respectively. The morphological and structural characteristics of catalysts were examined by XRD, SEM, XPS, and BET. The catalyst MnO2-6 h (Î²-MnO2) synthesized in six hours by hydrothermal method showed higher performance in destroying SDZ compared to MnO2-3 h (Î»-MnO2) obtained by acid leaching method.

Such a surge in the LIB market and industry has resulted in a huge demand for mineral resources. Besides, the large scale of production will lead to massive amounts of waste batteries in the end. As such, recycling is seen as an end-of-pipe process to resolve sustainability and environmental concerns. The hydrometallurgical recycling is considered to be the most prominent method to recover cathode materials from spent LIBs owing to its high leaching efficiency and low energy costs. A series of procedures including pretreatment of the spent LIBs, acid leaching of the black mass, chemical co-precipitation of the hydroxide precursor, and sintering of the cathode active material need to be operated precisely. In this aspect, the impurities introduced during the process could pose a serious threat to the reaction stability as well as recycling consistency. Here, the impact of sulfide ions on recovered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cathode material with the method of hydrometallurgy is first investigated in detail. This study shows that hydrometallurgical process is not obviously influenced by sulfide impurity. No signs of secondary phase or impurity inclusion are spotted in synthesized cathodes.

Co-precipitative regeneration of spent LIBs is typically employed to recycle Li, Co, Ni, and Mn. However, it is difficult to evenly distribute metals in the regenerated materials. Moreover, the emission of heavy-metal ions makes it difficult to meet the environmental guidelines. Here, we develop a nucleationâ€“oxidation coupled technology to efficiently recover Ni, Co, and Mn from spent ternary cathodes by forming layered double hydroxides (LDHs) in a micro-liquid-film reactor. After recycling, 98% Li remains in the liquid phase, while the Ni, Co, and Mn in the filtrate decrease to the ppb level. Atomic distribution of Ni, Co, and Mn can be achieved in LDH, which helps realize the full-life-cycle of ternary cathode materials.

Results revealed that LA of 6.86 M was able to achieve complete leaching of all target metals in the absence of reductants at the optimal conditions (10 L/kg, 90 Â°C, and 48 h) identified by the models. The evaluation of direct one- and two-step and indirect bioleaching indicated that the latter was more feasible for metal extraction from waste NCM523. L/S was found to impact the indirect bioleaching most significantly among the three operating variables. Pretreatment of waste NCM523 by washing with 1 vol% methanesulfonic acid significantly improved indirect bioleaching. The side-by-side comparison of these two leaching approaches on the same cathode active material (CAM) thus provided the technical details for further comparison with respect to cost and environmental impact.",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),leaching,"10 L/kg, 90 Â°C, 48 h","lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese",90

The synthesis process of NCM cathode material enlightened us to apply reduction roasting to break LiNi x Co y Mn z O2 into simple compounds or metals. Accordingly, the effect of several factors such as temperature, carbon dosage and roasting time is assessed on the leaching efficiency of valuable metals. The roasted products are analyzed by XRD and SEM-EDS, and the results show that the cathode material after reduction roasting is primarily transformed into Li2CO3, Ni, Co and MnO. However, the solubility of Li2CO3 is relatively low, so carbonated water leaching is used to treat the roasted products. Then the filtrate is evaporated for the preparation of pure Li2CO3, and residue is leached to recycle other metals with H2SO4. The results indicate that, after roasted at 650 Â°C for 3 h with 19.9% carbon dosage, 84.7% Li is preferentially recovered via carbonated water leaching, and more than 99% Ni, Co and Mn are recycled via acid leaching without adding reductant. Finally, the products of Li2CO3, NiSO4, CoSO4 and MnSO4 are obtained.

Pyrolysis has been preliminarily proven to be an efficient method to dispose spent LIBs and recycle valuable metals. However, the kinetics and reaction mechanism during this pyrolysis process still remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, the pyrolysis kinetics and reaction mechanism of a typical spent LIB (LiCoO2 battery) was investigated and revealed in depth. The results indicated that the reactions happened to the electrode materials (LiCoO2, C) were mainly in the range of 500âˆ’800 Â°C. Two iso-conversion methods (Kissingerâ€“Akahiraâ€“Sunose model and Flynnâ€“Wallâ€“Ozawa model) could both well describe the pyrolysis process, and the corresponding activation energies obtained were 389.61 and 405.67 kJ/mol respectively. The physicochemical properties of the pyrolysis products were detailedly characterized to reveal the reaction mechanism. The pyrolysis reaction mechanism of the electrode materials was firstly proposed and divided into three stages: firstly, LiCoO2 was decomposed into CoO, O2 and Li2O; then Li2O reacted with CO2 to form Li2CO3; finally CoO was reduced and converted into Co.

Recycling of the major components from spent LIBs is, therefore, considered desirable to prevent environmental pollution and to recycle valuable metals. This study reports on the application of ultrasonic-assisted technology to the leaching of cobalt and lithium from the cathode active materials of spent LIBs. Three acids were tested for the leaching process: two inorganic acids (H2SO4 and HCl) and one organic acid (citric acid, C6H8O7Â·H2O). The results show that the leaching of Co and Li is more efficient with citric acid than with the two inorganic acids. More than 96% Co and nearly 100% Li were recovered from spent LIBs.

However, a huge amount of low-grade electronic waste heat generated by these DCs is dissipated directly into the environment with the assistance of the energy-driven cooling system, thereby doubling the production of energy waste. Thus, innovative cooling and low-grade waste heat recovery technologies in DCs are urgently needed. In this study, we proposed a loop heat pipe battery (LHPB) with dual gradient wicks relay. According to the gradient wick relay strategy, the heat leakage at the evaporator inlet was alleviated, allowing the vapor inside to remove heat more rapidly and impact the micro-generator installed at the condenser inlet. Furthermore, two kinds of high-efficiency microgenerators were designed. The experimental results showed that under forced convection cooling of a 12 V fan, the cooling capacity of the LHPB with wicks relay was 288 W with a junction temperature maintained below 85 Â°C. The minimum total thermal resistance and nominal power usage effectiveness were 0.20 Â°C/W and 1.0015, respectively. The maximum rotor speed was 10,716 r/min and the maximum output power of the two generators was 195 and 280 mW.

To reduce the reagent consumption and wastewater generation presented in the individual metal element separation processes, a synergistic solvent extraction (SSX) process that selectively co-extracted Ni, Co, and Mn by the mixed extractant of pyridine carboxylate ester and naphthalene sulfonic acid was developed. Furthermore, the unit operation optimization and the extraction mechanism were systematically investigated. Experimental results demonstrated that almost all the Ni and Co were selectively extracted and left the impurities such as Ca and Mg in the raffinate by the synergistic extraction under optimal conditions. Moreover, a quantitative extraction of Mn could be achieved by controlling the excess coefficient of the organic extractant. By the aid of FTIR, HRMS, and the slope method, the molecular formula of loaded organic was deduced as Ni(C16H25NO2)2(C28H43O3S)2Â·2H2O, in which structure nickel forms a stable six-coordination complex with the extractant and H2O. Then, a battery-grade Ni/Co/Mn sulfate solution (Ca less than 0.02 mg/L, Mg less than 0.05 mg/L) was produced by stripping with 0.75 mol/L H2SO4 solutions.

The current work details a novel approach to recover nickel alloy, using two waste streams: positive electrode materials of waste Ni-MH battery as Ni source in oxide form and e-waste plastics as a reductant. As an alternative to the use of conventional carbon, characterization studies, gas evolution kinetics, weight loss, fine black carbon generation were performed on e-waste plastics before carrying out the reduction of Nickel oxide at 1550 Â°C in an argon atmosphere in a high-temperature horizontal tube furnace. The selected temperature (1550 Â°C) favors the reduction without the addition of any additives and diminishes the formation of toxic compounds such as dioxins. FTIR gas spectra of the e-waste plastics confirmed the gradual decrease of functional groups, such as poly-methylene, phenol, and styrene as temperature increased from 400 Â°C to 850 Â°C.

Different synthesis methods including the co-precipitation method, hydrothermal method, and impregnation method are used to prepare different morphologies of Î±-MnO2 catalysts and their catalytic activities of toluene oxidation are investigated.

Electrode materials containing lithium and cobalt can be concentrated with a two-step thermal and mechanical treatment. The leaching behavior of lithium and cobalt in nitric acid media is investigated in terms of reaction variables.

To sustain the supply of the elements and contribute to its circularity, LIB recycling is one of the justified routes. Although hydrometallurgy is considered as the most common process in battery recycling, improvements are still required to make the recycling process cleaner by reducing the steps and minimizing the chemical use. To achieve this goal, co-precipitation method is proposed to produce cathode active metals (CAM) of Li, Ni, Mn and Co from the leach solution. As battery chemistry is evolving fast, in near future, the dominant LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (LNMC 111) type will be replaced by other types with different NMC ratios. Hence, in this study, co-precipitation was tested to recover Li, Ni, Mn and Co from various leachates with different metal compositions, simulating leachates from different battery chemistries.

As the reduction reactions proceed, the dielectric properties of the material increase rapidly from 600â€¯Â°C, which means that microwave heating can promote a carbothermal reduction reaction. The effect of the carbon dose on the dielectric properties indicates that the carbothermal reduction reaction can fully occur when the carbon dose reaches 18%.

Subsequently, a novel method of self-catalytic air pressure leaching was proposed to selectively recover lithium from spent LFP batteries, which ingeniously employs green and cost-free air as the oxidant and self-owned Fe in the LiFePO4 as the O2 deliverer and catalyst. 98.9% Li and only 0.41% Fe, and 3.01% P were leached from spent LFP materials under 0.4 MPa of air pressure, n (H2SO4)/n (Li) ratio of 0.5, liquid to solid ratio of 20 mL/g, 90 Â°C, and 5 h.

This study introduced pyrite ore (FeS2) as an alternative additive to achieve the selective recovery of Li2CO3 from spent LiCoO2 (LCO) batteries. The mechanism study revealed that the sulfation reaction followed two pathways. During the initial stage (550 Â°Câ€“800 Â°C), the decomposition and oxidation of FeS2 and the subsequent gasâ€“solid reaction between the resulting SO2 and layered LCO play crucial roles. The sulfation of lithium occurred prior to cobalt, resulting in the disruption of layered structure of LCO and the transformation into tetragonal spinel. In the second stage (over 800 Â°C), the dominated reactions were the decomposition of orthorhombic cobalt sulfate and its combination with rhombohedral Fe2O3 to form CoFe2O4. The deintercalation of Li from LCO by the substitution of Fe and conversion of Co(III)/Fe(II) into Co3O4/CoFe2O4 were further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation results.

Most of the current research materials are pure cathode electrode materials obtained through manual disassembly. However, the spent LIBs are typically broken as a whole during the actual industrial recycling which makes the electrode materials combined with the collector fluid. Therefore, the competitive leaching between metal collector fluid and electrode material was examined. The pyrolysis characteristics of the electrode materials were analyzed to determine the pyrolysis temperature. The electrode sheet was pyrolyzed and then crushed for competitive leaching. The effect of pyrolysis was analyzed by XPS. The competitive leaching behavior was studied based on leaching agent concentration, leaching time and leaching temperature. The composition and morphology of the residue were determined to prove the competitive leaching results by XRD-SEM. TG results showed that 500 Â°C was the suitable pyrolysis temperature. XPS analysis demonstrated that pyrolysis can completely remove PVDF. Li and Co were preferentially leached during the competitive leaching while the leaching rates were 90.10% and 93.40% with 50 min leaching at 70 Â°C. The Al and Cu had weak competitive leachability and the leaching rate was 29.10% and 0.00%. XRD-SEM analysis showed that Li and Co can be fully leached with residual Al and Cu remaining.

Due to the presence of organic components (electrolyte, separator, casings, etc.), future recycling technologies will combine thermal pre-treatment followed by hydrometallurgical processing. Despite the ongoing application of such treatment, there is still a lack of information on how applied parameters affect subsequent metal recovery. In this study, both oxidative and reductive conditions in dependence on temperature and time were studied. Qualitative and quantitative characterizations of the samples after treatment were performed followed by leaching with 2 M sulphuric acid at ambient temperature to determine the leachability of valuable metals such as Co, Mn, Ni and Li. Moreover, the negative or positive effect of treatment on the leachability of the main impurities (Cu and Al) was determined. Since the presence of carbon affects the degree of active material reduction, it's content after each thermal treatment was determined as well. If all variables, temperature and time of thermal processing are taken into account, pyrolysis at 700 Â°C for 30 min is the optimal treatment. Under these conditions, full recovery is reached after 2 min for Li, 5 min for Mn and 10 min for both Co and Ni.

In the traditional recovery process of spent LIBs, the leaching of high-valence metals has the problems of high cost and limited reagent utilization, and some valuable metals are lost in the subsequent purification process of the leaching solution. To reduce the cost of reagents, this study proposes the use of low-cost SO2 as a reagent combined with pressure leaching to efficiently recover high-valence metals from delithiated materials of spent LIBs, while selective solvent extraction is used to remove trace impurities in the leaching solution to avoid the loss of valuable metals. Experimental results demonstrated that by optimizing the conditions to 0.25 MPa SO2 partial pressure and 60 min reaction time at 70 Â°C, the leaching efficiencies for Ni, Co, and Mn reached 99.6%, 99.3%, and 99.6%, respectively.

The mother liquor generated from the precipitation of lithium carbonate in this process is often managed by evaporative crystallization process which is high energy-consuming and expensive. The methodology employed in this research involves pretreatment and bipolar membrane electrodialysis to partition salts within the mother liquor into acids and bases, thereby achieving cost savings. The findings reveal that a significant 76.5â€¯% reduction in COD is achievable through the application of potassium permanganate and activated carbon in the treatment of the mother liquor. Subsequently, the treated mother liquor can be transfer to electrodialysis process for further treatment.

Here, we propose a dual closed-loop process for resource utilization of spent LIBs. As an alternative to strong inorganic acids, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as green solvents are employed for the recycling of spent LIBs. The DES based on oxalic acid (OA) and choline chloride (ChCl) achieves efficient leaching of valued metals within a short time. Through the coordination adjustment of water, it can form high-value battery precursors directly in DES, changing wastes into valuables. Meanwhile, water as a diluent can achieve the selective separation of lithium ions via filtration. More importantly, DES can be perfectly re-generated and recycled many times, indicating that the process is cost-effective and eco-friendly. As experimental proof, the re-generated precursors were used to produce new Li(Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3)O2 (NCM523) button batteries.

During the separation and recovery of different metals, excessive chemical consumption caused by prolonged processes may eventually spoil the environmentally soundness recycling of spent LIBs. Here, Ferro-chemistry was innovatively proposed towards the recycling of different metals based on transformation of iron morphology from different types of spent LIBs (LiCoO2 and LiFePO4). It can be concluded from the thermodynamic results that redox reaction will take place in dilute sulfuric acid medium without addition of reductant/oxidant, indicating that Fe(II) in LFP can be used as reductant for the direct leaching of LiCoO2. Leaching results indicate that 99.9% Li, Fe, P and 92.4% Co can be dissolved and existed as Fe3+, Li+, PO4 3âˆ’ and Co2+ under the optimized conditions, with a decline of over 80% acid consumption. The leaching kinetics of different metals and reaction mechanism suggest that Fe(II) will be promptly liberated to lixivium and then slowly oxidized into Fe(III) with the existence of Co(III), resulting in a synergetic leaching of Co and Fe. Then, Fe(III) can be precipitated as FePO4 at pH of 2.5, which can remove PO4 3âˆ’ with the direct generation of LiFePO4 precursors.

However, the limited supply of REEs and the significant environmental impact associated with their extraction and concentration have prompted countries to explore recycling options for REE-bearing waste. Despite this, the lack of an efficient recycling method remains a challenge. This study proposes a chemical-based approach towards the recovery of rare earth oxides (REOs), which facilitates a clean separation of REOs with purities exceeding 99.1 wt% and 97.1, along with recovery rates more than 99.3 wt% and 97.1, respectively, from permanent Nd-Fe-B magnets and Ni-MH batteries. Initially, REEs (La, Ce, Nd, Pr, Dy, and Sm) were thermally isolated from Ni- and Fe-based metallic alloys, while still containing impurities. The impurities were subsequently removed via an oxalate chemical separation. Thermodynamics of REE oxalate formation indicated that the precipitation of pure REE oxalates occurs only at pHâ‰ˆ0.0. As the pH increases, impurities such as Ni are introduced into the REO products. The abundance of C2O4 2- decreases the selective separation, whereas HC2O4 - recovers REEs from the leachate at pHâ‰ˆ0.0. The proposed pH range, as indicated by the speciation plots, not only restricts the trace of contamination but also maximizes the efficiency of the process. XPS analysis of the chemically isolated REOs indicated no sign of major impurities. The pure REOs recovered in this study can be used as a high-purity precursor for other applications.

This research proposes to make full use of aluminum and carbon â€“ main constituents of waste LIBs â€“ as reductants in the roasting process. Results show that the aluminum-carbon reduction roasting method has a higher efficiency compared with the traditional carbon reduction. Lithium present in ternary materials can be almost completely transformed into soluble Li2CO3, while the associated Ni, Co and Mn are all converted into insoluble metal elements or their corresponding oxides at 650 Â°C (t = 90 min). The presence of Al decreases the carbothermal roasting temperature, while the presence of waste carbon allows Li to be converted into easily soluble lithium carbonate in preference to lithium aluminate. The optimal amount of carbon and Al in the spent LIBs were 14.7% and 7.0%, respectively. After roasting, > 97% of Li could be selectively leached by carbonated water leaching, while only < 0.5% of Al, Ni, Co, and Mn dissolved. The leach residues obtained were purified by alkali treatment with 3 mol/L NaOH at 90 Â°C to achieve > 99% Al separation. These results suggest that the in-situ aluminum-carbon reduction roasting, followed by selective leaching of Li and Al, mitigates several of the challenges related to battery recycling: (i) Li extraction is increased substantially above the state-of-the-art recovery efficiencies, (ii) Al - known to decrease battery metals extraction in hydrometallurgical processing - is selectively removed after making full use of its reducibility and (iii) battery metal-rich residues with low impurity levels is produced for further refining, therefore paving the way towards more economical, efficient and environmentally friendly spent LIBs recycling.",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),roasting process,"650 Â°C, t = 90 min","lithium carbonate, alkali-leached residues",650

Moreover, leaching processes of Ni, Co and Mn fit well with the film diffusion control model, and the reaction barrier is in accordance with the order of Ni, Co and Mn.

In this study, we demonstrate the dissolution of LiCoO2 (LCO) in a low-acid leaching system that utilizes typical battery elements which can be found in impure, recycled black masses; Fe2+ as a reducing agent towards LCO, and Cu as a reducing agent towards Fe3+. We show for the first time that the Cu-Fe2+-H2SO4 system can provide an excellent performance in dissolving LCO materials at low acid environment and near-room temperature (T = 30 Â°C), even to the point where the acidity of the solution decreases to pH = 1.89 while reaching Co extraction of 92%. To the best of our knowledge, such high leaching efficiency has not been previously reported under such mild conditions. Nowadays, recyclability of the process waters may also be important, and herein we highlighted the influence of Na2SO4 on leaching of LCO active materials as well in this system.

Therefore, proper treatment of these wastes is necessary to prevent their harmful effects on human health and the environment. Current recycling processes are mainly applied to treat each type of spent battery separately. In this laboratory study, a hydrometallurgical process has been developed to simultaneously and efficiently solubilize metals from spent batteries. Among the various chemical leaching agents tested, sulfuric acid was found to be the most efficient and cheapest reagent. A Box-Behnken design was used to identify the influence of several parameters (acid concentration, solid/liquid ratio, retention time and number of leaching steps) on the removal of metals from spent batteries. According to the results, the solid/liquid ratio and acid concentration seemed to be the main parameters influencing the solubilization of zinc, manganese, nickel, cadmium and cobalt from spent batteries.

An experimental technique using mineral processing techniques, crushing and grinding, are proposed to recycle critical metals from CIGS solar panel. In this study, the crushing experiments were conducted and the size based elemental distribution was analysed. The results showed crushing is capable to delaminate glass substrate and Fuerstenau upgrading curves and the ore separation degree were used to show that selective liberation occurs and the critical metals concentrate in coarse size fraction but may not be fully liberated.

The emerging titanium-based coagulants have drawn growing attentions due to their strong coagulation capability in water purification and value-added Ti-loaded sludge production. Management and recovery of the high value-added sludge into functional nanomaterials is highly significant for both sludge reduction and environmental remediation. The present study was carried out to investigate the recycle of the coagulated Ti-loaded sludge to produce functional C/TiO2 composites as the anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

Herein, a low-carbon, facile, and efficient method was developed to separate and recover Li, Al, and transition metals from spent ternary cathodes. Initially, the cathode materials post-discharge and disassembly do not require pre-sorting. Instead of using carbonaceous materials, the Al foil in the cathode serves as the reducing agent during reduction roasting. The impact of different roasting atmospheres (air, N2, CO2) on phase transitions and the extraction of valuable metals was examined. The findings revealed that after synergistic thermite reduction in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, the cathode material is completely dissociated. Li is selectively converted to Li2CO3 rather than LiAlO2, and the reduced reactivity of the Al foil encourages the formation of lower-valence oxides of Ni and Co, rather than their metallic forms. Under optimal roasting conditions at 650 Â°C for 1.0 h, 91.4% of Li can be preferentially and selectively extracted through carbonation water leaching, with less than 0.1% of Al and transition metals dissolving. Subsequently, âˆ¼98% of Al and âˆ¼99% of Ni, Co, and Mn can be leached using alkaline and acidic solutions, respectively. Compared to the traditional carbon thermal reduction process, this process offers several advantages including the elimination of pre-sorting and additional reducing agents, lower carbon emissions, and higher recovery rates of valuable metals.

In this work, Mn0.27FeO4.55 (MFBO) was synthesized using the recovered waste alkaline battery and its catalytic activity and mechanism for PDS activation were explored in detail. Results show that MFBO exhibited a higher catalytic activity than the individual single metal oxides (FeOx and Mn2O3) due to the synergistic effect between Fe and Mn elements.

This work describes a unique and environmentally acceptable bioleaching method for Li and Mn recovery utilizing Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, a sulfur-oxidizing bacteria that may produce sulfuric acid biologically. The novel feature of this strategy is the step-by-step addition of biogenic sulfuric acid, which differs significantly from conventional methods that use chemical reagents. We expected that gradually introducing biogenic sulfuric acid produced by A. thiooxidans would improve metal leaching at high pulp density. To investigate this, LIBs were disassembled and bioleached with or without a step-wise addition of the biogenic sulfuric acid approach. The impact on leaching efficiency, time, and ultimate product quality was assessed. Direct bioleaching yielded modest Li (43 %) and Mn (15 %) recoveries. However, bioleaching greatly increased metal recovery with the step-wise addition of biogenic acid. Li and Mn leaching efficiency were 93 % and 53 %, respectively, at a high pulp density of 60 g/L, while leaching time was reduced from 16 to 8 days. Following bioleaching, Mn(OH)2 and Li2CO3 were successfully precipitated from the leachate at more than 90 % purity. This study shows that gradually adding biogenic sulfuric acid can efficiently recover Li and Mn from waste LIBs. This approach has several environmental and economic advantages over conventional methods. The step-wise addition optimizes the leaching environment, increasing metal recovery rates while reducing the development of hazardous byproducts. This approach is environmentally friendly because it decreases greenhouse gas emissions and chemical waste. Economically, this technology offers potential cost savings through less chemical usage, shorter processing times, and lower energy needs, making it a more sustainable and cost-effective option for LIB recycling.

In this study, an integrated thermal management topology for range-extended electric vehicles is proposed, which recovers the waste heat from the range extender and the electric drive system for the heating of the battery and the cabin to improve energy utilization. Considering the driving modes and heating demands, the working modes and switching rules are designed. Especially, a control-oriented coupling system model is established for pure-electric mode. Taking cabin heat load demand, battery heat generation, and electric drive system heat generation as disturbances, a model predictive controller is designed for the heating power of the heater.

This study explores a reactor for pyrometallurgical recycling, that offers the potential to overcome this bottleneck by simultaneously recovering lithium and phosphorous (P) via the gas stream, more noble elements including cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu) as an alloy and less noble elements like aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca) and silicium (Si) as a slag. However, to enhance the efficiency and performance of this reactor, a critical focus is placed on evaluating refractory materials with reduced corrosion and diffusion characteristics. Already explored refractory materials, including aluminum oxide (Al2O3) or magnesium oxide (MgO), have exhibited severe issues, such as accelerated corrosion and diffusion rates, leading to diminished performance and compromised efficiency. To evaluate a more suitable refractory material for pyrometallurgical recycling of LIB, tests using silicon carbide (SiC), chromium(III)-oxide (Cr2O3) and zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) were performed up to 1600 Â°C. The test results indicate that the investigated refractory materials offer distinct advantages and disadvantages. While SiC shows minimal to no wear by corrosion, Cr2O3 exhibits higher resistance to Li diffusion. Contrary, ZrO2 experienced severe corrosion and crack formation, showing unsuitability for LIB recycling.

LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries have been widely used in new energy vehicles. The main reason for the performance degradation of LFP cathodes is the loss of Li, oxidation of Fe, and the destruction of crystal structure and surface carbon layer. Here, an in-situ repair strategy of high-temperature calcination, using impurities remaining in cathode blackmass (e.g., LiPF6, LiPO3, Fe2O3, acetylene black, binder, and electrolyte) as raw materials, was proposed. During the calcination process, the residual LiPF6 is converted into Li, acting as a lithium source to fill the vacancies. The residual binder and electrolyte are pyrolyzed into amorphous carbon and carbon nanotubes, which deposit on the LFP particles to repair the missing carbon layer and enhance the conductivity of the electrode material. The pyrolytic carbon and residual acetylene black can provide a reducing atmosphere, converting Fe3+ to Fe2+. Additionally, the residual LiPO3 and Fe2O3 impurities undergo recrystallization forming new LFP. The failed LFP was restored to the same level as commercial LFP by calcining at 750 Â°C for 3 h.

However, the hydrometallurgical process usually has drawbacks of high consumption of chemical reagents and difficulty in removing impurities (especially Fe and Ba elements) from the recovered product. In this paper, a closed-loop ammonium salt system is proposed for spent lead-acid battery paste recovery. Both recirculation of leaching reagents and preparation of low-impurity recovered products have been realized. The spent lead paste is first leached by a mixed solution of ammonium acetate, acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide. After filtration, the separated lead acetate solution is reacted with ammonium carbonate to generate lead carbonate via precipitation process. The impurity elements are efficiently removed by pH control and complexation between acetate ions and impurity elements in the leaching and precipitation processes. The soluble SO4 2âˆ’ separated from the precipitation process is removed by adding barium acetate to generate solid BaSO4 by-product. At the same time, the regenerated ammonium acetate filtrate is separated and re-used in the next-round leaching process in order to realize a closed-loop process.

The acidic leaching solutions containing lanthanides (La, Ce, and Nd) and base metals (Ni, Cd, Mn, Fe, Al, and Zn) were from spent NiMH batteries subject to subcritical water extraction (SWE) process using 0.5 mol/L of HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4 solution, respectively. The effects of important parameters such as the molar ratio of lanthanides to phosphate ions, Ln/P, to form precipitates of lanthanide phosphates (Ln(PO4)), pH and temperature were investigated. The recovery efficiency of lanthanides increased when decreasing Ln/P, while increased with increasing pH and temperature. The decrease in the concentration of Ln remaining in HCl and HNO3 leaching solutions was proportional to the decrease in the P concentration in leaching solutions, while different results were found in the leaching solution of H2SO4 due to the formation of another insoluble lanthanide mineral, double sulfate (NaLn(SO4)2Â·H2O). This separation process demonstrated that the high-purity lanthanide group including La, Ce, and Nd from spent NiMH batteries could be obtained simply by adding phosphate ions at low pH.

Despite the natural abundance of this element on Earth, large-scale production of high-purity Si nanomaterials in a green and energy-efficient way is yet to become an industrial reality. Spray-drying methods have been exploited to recover Si particles from low-value sludge produced in the photovoltaic industry, providing a massive and cost-effective Si resource for fabricating anode materials.

In this work, a simple and low energy consumption roasting method was proposed by employing low-temperature eutectic NaOH-KOH as reaction medium, in order to simultaneously separate graphite from Cu foils, extract lithium from it and set it up for reuse as environmental catalyst through one-step water washing process. Our results show that polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) was effectively deactivated due to dehydrofluorination/carbonization at a relatively low temperature and short time (150 Â°C, 20 min) when a mass ratio of 1:1 for eutectic NaOH-KOH to spent LIBs anodes was used, yielding 97.3 % of graphite detached. Moreover, a remarkable lithium extraction efficiency of 93.2 % was simultaneously obtained. Afterwards, the reusability of the recycled graphite was tested by employing it as a catalyst for the treatment of a contaminant organic dye (Rhodamine B) in the presence of NaClO. Our results show that a superior NaClO activation was obtained with the addition of recycled graphite, being this fact closely associated to the abundant active sites formed during the long-term charging/discharging cycles in the original battery.

Organic binders wrapped on electrode particles are usually the main reason that causes the difficulty of liberation and extraction of electrode materials. Pyrolysis or incineration is the general approach to separate the organic binder, leading to fluorinated exhaust gas emissions. In this study, the supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2) combined with a cosolvent dimethyl sulfoxide was innovatively adapted to enable the extraction of organic binders from spent LIBs to facilitate the liberation of the cathode material from aluminum foil. Pure polyvinylidene fluoride was preferentially used to study the SC CO2 dissolution mechanism. The results indicate that 98.5 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) dissolves in SC CO2 dimethyl sulfoxide system under the optimum conditions; 70Â°C process temperature, 80 bar pressure, and 13 min duration. After removing PVDF, the recovered sample was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) to observe its possible re-utilization. It is clear that the surficial chemical groups and content remained the same after treatment.

But to achieve an optimized sustainable recycling process, a fundamental understanding of the thermokinetic reactions during pyrometallurgical LIB recycling is essential. In this work, the thermodynamics and kinetics of high-temperature reactions for LIBs during pyrometallurgical recycling are studied using a thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA) equipped with a gas mass spectrometer. Cylindrical composite pellets comprised of cathode and anode active materials were heated from room temperature (RT) to 1500 Â°C at a constant heating rate of 20 Â°C/min. By comparing the measurements of the mass loss and simultaneous gas evolution, the anticipated theoretical thermodynamic reactions are confirmed and determined, which is fundamental to the development of a sustainable pyrometallurgical process to recover valuable metals in LIBs.

Bioleaching, which uses microorganisms to extract valuable metals, is both economical and environmentally safe compared to other recycling methods, but its practical application is impaired by slow kinetics. Accelerating the process is a key for bioleaching spent LIBs on an industrial scale. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (A. ferrooxidans), which thrives in extremely low pH conditions, has long been explored for bioleaching of spent LIBs. Metabolism of A. ferrooxidans involves the oxidation of magnetic Fe2+ and produces intracellular magnetic nanoparticles. The possibility of accelerating the leaching kinetics of A. ferrooxidans by the application of an external magnetic field is explored in this work. A weak static magnetic field is applied during the bioleaching of spent LIBs to recover Li, Ni, and Co using A. ferrooxidans. It is determined that 3 mT is the optimal field strength which allows the leaching efficiency of Li to reach 100% after only 2 days of leaching at a pulp density of 3 w/v % while without the external magnetic field, the leaching efficiency is limited to 57% even after 4 days. The leaching efficiency of Ni and Co also increases by nearly three-fold to >80% after 4 days of leaching. The proposed magnetic field-assisted bioleaching of spent LIBs using A. ferrooxidans substantially improves the leaching kinetics and thus the cost-effectiveness of the bioleaching process with minimal environmental impact, hence enabling environment-friendly recycling of raw materials that are increasingly becoming scarce.

A major drawback of this approach is the slagging of lithium, which limits its recovery and usually requires thermal energy and large amounts of leaching reagents using a hydrometallurgical recovery process in order to accomplish a return into the material cycle. To counteract this disadvantage, the present study investigates the fine grinding behaviour of battery slags in a stirred media mill and its possibility to increase the solubility of lithium containing slag phases. As the main influencing factors, the grinding media stress energy, processing time, and the pH value were investigated. The results show that by selecting suitable fine grinding process parameters, the specific surface area of the battery slag can be increased significantly from 0.2 m2/g to 55 m2/g and a lithium dissolution efficiency of up to 30 % can be reached in an aqueous environment. The variation of pH value during fine grinding enables a further process improvement with a dissolution efficiency of up to 90 % at pH=4.

Special conditions to achieve high lithium recovery and its use in new batteries represent a challenge for a commercial hydrometallurgical approach. In this work, an early selective recovery of lithium using oxalic acid as a leaching agent is investigated. The different solubility of transition metals oxalates in comparison to lithium oxalate was the main driving force to achieve selective separation in the leaching step. Nickel, cobalt, and manganese oxalates are insoluble and remained in the solid residue, while lithium oxalate was dissolved in the solution. Using a design of experiments to optimize the operation, optimal parameters were identified as 60 Â°C, 60 min, 0.6 M oxalic acid, resulting in 98.8% leaching yield for lithium, while less than 0.5 % of cobalt and nickel, and 1.5% of manganese were leached.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with image analysis via density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is presented as a novel method to quantitatively determine the degree of selectivity in a process that applies selective flocculation as a conditioning stage for froth flotation. SEM was shown to provide visual proof of flocculated particles, even in dried froth samples. Under optimal flocculant concentration of 10 g/t only a few flocs were detected in the froth concentrate, suggesting that heteroflocculation of LCO and graphite was minimized under said conditions. Using a flocculant concentration in excess (50 g/t) resulted in multiple flocculated LCO particles within the froth, indicating loss of flocculation selectivity. These results were corroborated by batch flotation experiments, which showed that treating the pulp with 10 g/t flocculant concentration yielded a graphite froth product at a grade of 98.2 %, compared to 98.1 % recovered from a non-flocculated pulp. An excess flocculant concentration led to a drastic reduction in graphite grade. Similar graphite recoveries were observed in all flotation experiments, indicating that the reduced graphite grade with excess flocculant was a result of hydrophobic heteroflocs carrying entrapped LCO to the froth. Proper pH control throughout the experiment prevented a negative influence of flocculation on the kinetics of graphite recovery, which had been reported in earlier research.

The four solid chlorinating agents were systematically compared in terms of the direct chlorination capacities, indirect chlorination capacities, alloy physical losses and chemical losses in the slag. CaCl2 was better suited for use as a solid chlorinating agent to promote Li volatilization due to its excellent results in these indexes. The temperature required for the release of HCl from MgCl2, facilitated by CO2 and SiO2, was lower than 500 Â°C. The prematurely released HCl failed to participate in the chlorination reaction. This resulted in approximately 12 % less Li volatilization when MgCl2 was used as a chlorinating agent compared to when CaCl2 was used. In addition, the use of KCl as a chlorinating agent decreased the chemical dissolution loss of alloys in the slag. The performance of NaCl was mediocre.

Using H2SO4 as solvent and selecting appropriate conditions of temperature and concentration, all residues were dissolved except carbon. The separation and recovery of the two components were performed by electrodeposition with satisfactory results at pH values above 4 (current efficiency above 70% for Zn and Mn) but rather lower efficiencies as the pH decreased. Most of the Zn was selectively dissolved by alkaline leaching using a 6.5M NaOH solution, and its recovery was examined by means of both electrochemical and chemical processes. The expected formation of pure Zn by electrowinning failed due to the formation of ZnO, the content of which was highly dependent on the electrodeposition time. For short periods, Zn was the main component. For longer periods the electrodeposit consisted of agglomerated microparticles of ZnO with a minor fraction of Zn metal (barely 3% as measured by X-ray diffraction). A chemical reaction of the element with oxygen released at the anode surface might be responsible for its conversion to ZnO.

The electrodic powder recovered by industrial scale mechanical treatment of spent batteries was leached and the dissolved metals were precipitated as mixed metals carbonates. Nanowires battery-type positive electrodes were produced by electrodeposition into nanoporous alumina templates from the electrolytic baths prepared by dissolution of the precipitated carbonates. The impact of the different metals contained in the electrodic powder was evaluated by benchmarking the electrochemical performances of the recovered nanowires-based electrodes against electrodes produced by using high-purity salts. Presence of inactive Cu in the nanowires lowered the final capacitance of the electrodes while Ni showed a synergistic effect with cobalt providing a higher capacitance with respect to synthetic Co electrodes. The carbonaceous solid recovered after leaching was in-depth characterized and tested as negative electrode. Both the chemical and electrochemical characterization indicate that the recovered graphite is characterized by the presence of oxygen functionalities introduced by the leaching treatment.

Still, they are rarely used due to a poor understanding of their performance and reaction chemistry. In this study, two hypotheses bearing on the role of chemistry and influence of non-sugary organic compounds (impurities) on the performance of sugars, namely: glucose, fructose and sucrose, and a parent sugar-rich agro-industrial by-product â€“ molasses, as reductants in the leaching of Li, Co, Mn and Ni from spent lithium-ion battery cathode material were tested.

Prior to the flotation separation of spent LIBs, pyrolysis pretreatment plays a critical role in the removal of organic binding components from the particle surface.

Various analytical techniques, including X-ray Diffractometer (XRD), Field-emission Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy Disperse Spectroscopy (FSEM-EDS), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and contact angle measurements, are employed to analyze the samples. The experimental results reveal that the flotation performance is enhanced through the use of pyrolysis-grinding and pyrolysis-ultrasonic techniques combined with MNBs, resulting in improved recovery and metal content. The most optimal flotation performance is achieved with the pyrolysis-ultrasonic-MNBs method at a pyrolysis temperature and duration of 350 Â°C and 15 min, respectively, leading to an increase in the metal content of cathode materials from 65 Â± 3 % to 95 Â± 2 %.",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),pyrolysis-ultrasonic-MNBs,350 Â°C and 15 min,cathode materials,350

Herein, an effective pyrolysis with dimethyl formamide (DMF) was proposed to effectively separate CAMs from Al foils, which is difficult to be achieved by a facile process. The results indicate that the addition of DMF can enhance the separation of CAMs and Al foils by generating micro bubbles (Consisting of CH4, CO2, H2O, HF and CO) between them and about 98.93% of CAMs is recovered after the pyrolysis at 450 Â°C via facile screening process. During the pyrolysis process, DMF can also accelerate the decomposition of toxic electrolyte to non-toxic small molecule compounds, thus achieving the safe disposal of organic pollutants contained in spent LIBs. The SEM-EDS and XPS analyses reveal that the CAMs recovered by the process hardly contain Al impurity, which is beneficial to the regeneration of spent LiFePO4. The TGA-MS and TGA-FTIR analyses imply that PVDF and DMF are the two main substances that underwent chemical reactions during the pyrolysis process, in which lots of micro bubbles are produced between CAMs and Al foils. In situ FTIR spectroscopy and quantum-chemical simulations indicate that the intermediate pyrolysis products of DMF can promote the thermal decomposition of PVDF, which also favors the efficient separation of CAMs and Al foils.

The leaching behavior of Ni, Mn, Co, Al and Cu from treated cathode active materials, which are separated from a commercial LIB pack in hybrid electric vehicles, is investigated with ammoniacal leaching agents based on ammonia, ammonium carbonate and ammonium sulfite. Ammonium sulfite as a reductant is necessary to enhance leaching kinetics particularly in the ammoniacal leaching of Ni and Co. Ammonium carbonate can act as a pH buffer so that the pH of leaching solution changes little during leaching. Co and Cu can be fully leached out whereas Mn and Al are hardly leached and Ni shows a moderate leaching efficiency. It is confirmed that the cathode active materials are a composite of LiMn2O4, LiCoxMnyNizO2, Al2O3 and C while the leach residue is composed of LiNixMnyCozO2, LiMn2O4, Al2O3, MnCO3 and Mn oxides.

The absence of a sustainable recycling route for these wastes amidst a circular economy era makes it important to find a potential coupling route of their waste streams into useful products. Herein, the behaviour of zinc, manganese, and iron were tracked through a thermodynamics calculation of the thermal treatment of PVC mixed with SAB followed with a thermodynamic assessment of the leaching of the pyrolysis residues. thermodynamics calculations suggest that zinc and manganese can be extracted with a percentage of up to 100% if PVC is thermally treated with water washed SAB under pyrolytic conditions at a temperature of 300 Â°C. The residues from the thermal treatment (rich in zinc and manganese chlorides) should be then water leached (pH = 5 â€“ 6) to recover Zn2+ and Mn2+. Water washing of the SAB should help in suppressing the extraction of both sodium and potassium as they can be omitted from the reaction system when SAB is washed with water. However, the major drawback under the conditions above is that iron will still be extracted with zinc and manganese which can potentially cause complications in the separation at a further stage. Nonetheless, this work lays the foundation for further studies (theoretical and experimental) related to the extraction of zinc and manganese from SAB by means of thermally treating it with waste PVC.",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),pyrolysis and leaching,"pyrolysis temperature of 450 Â°C, pyrolysis time of 2 h, the leaching rate of Li2CO3 reached 99.66%",Li2CO3,450

In this paper, sodium carbonate roasting decomposition was used to treat the water leach residue, in which iron and rare earths were transformed into oxides, and the phosphorus was transformed into sodium phosphate. The main reactions and thermodynamic mechanisms of the roasting decomposition process were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis, phase analysis and chemical analysis. When the mass ratio of sodium carbonate to water leach residue is 1.5:1, the roasting temperature is 700 Â°C, and the roasting time is 1.5 h, the leaching rate of phosphorus with the roasted product reaches more than 98%.

While cadmium from batteries is one of the major sources of cadmium contamination of the environment, the other heavy metals contained on the electrode material have a considerable economic value. Therefore a complete and valorising solution to the management of this type of residues is not possible through the existing pyrometallurgical processes because the treatment of complex materials in order to recycle all materials is difficult. An integrated process based on physical and hydroelectrometallurgical operations seems to be more efficient because it is possible to recover the three metals, Cd, Ni and Co, present on the electrode material.

The electrode materials essentially composed of Ni, Cd and Co hydroxides were readily solubilised in 0.5 h with low acid concentrations (pHâˆ¼1) at ambient temperature. At higher pH values the solubilisation of metal hydroxides was inefficient, except when using long residence times. The leaching of nickel present in the metallic form, in the electrodes, was more difficult due to kinetic constraints, applying high temperature (e.g. 95 Â°C) and acid concentration (e.g. 2.5 M H2SO4) in order to obtain complete conversions in acceptable time (âˆ¼4 h).",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),Pyrometallurgical process,"1000 Â°C, 1 h, 500 g/L","Ni, Co, Li",1000

The detachment of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer is a critical step in the recycling of end-of-life (EoL) c-Si photovoltaic (PV) modules, but a clean and high-efficiency adhesive removal method is absent. In this study, we presented a green solvent-based approach using limonene with ultrasound assistance for the efficient delamination of EVA from c-Si PV modules. By adjusting the concentration of limonene solution, the degree of swelling of EVA was effectively controlled, reducing the risk of battery damage caused by uneven swelling.

On the other hand, this is some hundred degrees higher than the temperature at which first changes in the heating microscope could be observed and indicates that there are changes in the material before the reduction starts.

However, the utilization of excessive roasting conditions in current practices results in significant energy consumption and C emissions, thereby hindering further development. Herein, we propose a novel recycling strategy that combines mechanochemical activation (MCA) with biomass reduction roasting. The optimized roasting conditions with MCA pretreatment achieve a 100 Â°C reduction in roasting temperature, a halving of biomass ratio and roasting time, compared to the case without activation. By analyzing the changes in physicochemical properties of mixed samples (cathode materials and biomass) under different activation conditions and their impacts, the action mechanism of MCA on biomass reduction roasting is revealed. The introduction of MCA pretreatment achieves milder roasting conditions by promoting homogeneous mixing and disrupting NCM crystal structures through the â€œpre-oxygen elements removalâ€ process. Furthermore, mechanical treatment was applied to enhance the carbonated water leaching process. The results of sustainability analysis and economic evaluation demonstrate that the proposed recycling strategy not only reduces CO2 emissions and energy consumption but also generates considerable benefits. Overall, this high-efficiency and low-carbon recycling strategy provides a promising direction for the development of spent LIBs recycling technology.",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),mechanochemical activation (MCA) with biomass reduction roasting,"100 Â°C reduction in roasting temperature, halving of biomass ratio and roasting time",lithium,100

Techno-economic optimisation of an electric booster-assisted Carnot battery integrated into different data centres,"The transition to intermittent renewable energies will necessitate the integration of storage. An interesting technology is the Carnot battery (CB), a novel power-to-heat-to-power system, capable of harnessing waste energy streams. While initial studies have indicated that, under ideal conditions, CB can be competitive with conventional technologies such as chemical batteries, their economic viability in real-world applications remains uncertain. To fill this gap, this work explores the techno-economic potential of electric booster-assisted CB integrated within data centres. Motivation for this case study is the recovery of waste heat, leading to an improved electrical storage efficiency. To maximise the energy self-sufficiency and the internal rate of return, we have applied multi-criteria optimisation to the system design, under three different thermal integration scenarios and for two sets of climatic conditions, using a thermodynamic model and time series from a real data centre. Our analyses suggest that current projections for electricity prices and CB costs yield payback periods exceeding a decade, but that these could fall below ten years if the CB capital costs were halved. Furthermore, it turns out that the choice of optimum charging system (i.e. right balance between heat pump and electrical heater) is contingent on the heat source temperature and availability. For higher temperatures (e.g. 60 Â°C), heat pumps emerge as the financially most attractive option, thanks to their superior coefficient of performance, whereas for lower temperatures ( < 25 Â°C), resistive heaters are preferable. Results also show that when the aim is to increase the energy self-sufficiency, there exist an efficiency/charging capacity trade-off, which causes a dilemma for the system design. On the one hand, heat pumps are vital to increase the efficiency of the CB, but on the other hand, as the amount of thermal energy available at its source is limited by the data centre operations, electrical boosters are indispensable to increase the charging capacity. To soften this dilemma and enhance the techno-economic performance of thermally integrated CB, future research should explore more efficient booster configurations, such as dual heat source heat pumps.",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),hydrometallurgical leaching and electrochemical deposition,"HCl: H2O ratio 3:1, pH 1.0, 25 Â°C, 30 min leaching time, 95 % of the Li and Co were leached",cathode active material,25

Electrochemical leaching, a process that uses a reductant that is constantly regenerated electrochemically for the leaching of lithium-ion battery black mass (LIBBM), has shown high extraction efficiencies and sustainable scores. However, slow kinetics, reactor design challenges and lack of deeper understanding of the underlying processes are barriers to the optimization, scale-up, and market adoption of this technology. A kinetic study and mathematical model for dissolving LIBBM is presented to better understand the underlying mechanisms aiming to reduce the processing time and make predictions for future design and scale-up.

As a result, the leaching time was reduced from 7 h to under 1 h at a pulp density of 73 g/L, without external heating.

The demand for REEs has rapidly grown in recent years since they are used in high-tech and sustainable technologies such as high-performance magnets, rechargeable batteries, and low-energy fluorescent lamps. Due to the latest political tensions and low substitutability of REEs mining technology, the REEs world market is at risk. One of the crucial concepts of industrial strategy to reduce supply risks related to critical raw materials is to increase their recycling. Among others, end-of-life electronic equipment such as mobile phones, fluorescent lamps, and computer hard drives (e-waste) can be a promising source for REE recovery. Critical parameters for adsorptive recovery of REEs from e-wastes are selectivity that can be provided by functionalization of the adsorbent surface.

The recycling process considered in this work produces significant amounts of process water, which is generated during the opening of the batteries by means of electro-hydraulic fragmentation and the subsequent sorting of the components in aqueous solution. This process produces between 21.6 L and 30.3 L of process water per kg of batteries with a total phosphorus and a total fluorine concentration of 60-85 mg/L and 120-470 mg/L, respectively. Currently, the process water has to be disposed of as hazardous waste. The goal is to discharge the wastewater into the sewer system. For this the total phosphorus and total fluorine concentration must be reduced. The process water is mainly contaminated by the released electrolyte consisting of organic carbonates and conducting salts. 31-P and 19-F NMR shows conclusively that no hydrolysis takes place in this process water. The phosphorus is present exclusively in the form of the complex anion PF6 - and fluorine as F-, namely as FSI- from the conducting salt LiFSI and PF6 - from the conducting salt LiPF6. In order to meet the regulatory requirements for discharge into the sewage system, 70.4 % of the phosphorus and 89.3 % of the fluorine must be removed.

The feasibility was proved by Gibbs free energy calculations and experiments. Then, the effects of H2SO4 concentration, roasting temperature and roasting time were assessed on the leaching rate of valuable metals. The results indicate that the leaching efficiency of lithium increases firstly and then decreases with the increase of H2SO4 concentration, roasting temperature and roasting time, more than 91â€¯% lithium are leached under optimized experimental conditions: 50â€¯wt% H2SO4, roasting temperature of 650Â°C, and roasting time of 2â€¯h. Meanwhile, the selectivity of lithium is up to 88â€¯% which means overwhelming majority lithium have been separated completely. In addition, the factors which cause sintering phenomenon such as high temperature and longtime roasting will change the microstructure of roasted product extremely, which is inconducive to the subsequent water leaching. The investigations of the phase conversion mechanism by thermodynamic simulation and instrumental characterization indicated that the leaching behaviors of valuable metals might be influenced by the different reaction pathways of the compounds while changing roasting conditions. The recovery process can be divided into two stages: the partial structure of LiNi x Co y Mn z O2 was destroyed to form metal sulfates at ambient temperature and the solid phase reaction between unreacted LiNi x Co y Mn z O2 which contained Li+ in the unstable layered structure with transition metal sulfates at high temperature.

However, severe voltage decay upon discharge limits their practical specific energy. Herein, we first explore the effect of different A l ( O H ) 4 âˆ’ concentrations in alkaline electrolytes on the electrochemical oxidation of Al metal anodes (AMAs). Simulation analysis on the electrochemical impedance spectra of AMAs reveals that the formation of A l ( O H ) 4 âˆ’ reduces the OHâˆ’ concentration and negatively affects the reaction kinetics of AMAs, which is responsible for increased potentials of AMAs and the consequent voltage decay of Al-air batteries. Subsequently, a seeded precipitation process taking advantage of the lower solubility of A l ( O H ) 4 âˆ’ at 20 Â°C than at 50 Â°C is proposed to recover the voltage decay of Al-air batteries. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy demonstrates that more than 70 wt % of A l ( O H ) 4 âˆ’ in the electrolyte can be removed via this process.

An increasing concentration of alkyl monocarboxylic acid in the mixture of extractants results in a decrease in distribution coefficient of cobalt and manganese, however, the separation factor value (Î²(Mn/Co)) increases at pH 4.5.

The distribution of metals indicated that most of Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Ni moved to the ingot, while Al, Ca, Mg, and Si stayed in the slag; Hg vaporized as gas phase into the flue gas; and Cd, Pb, and Zn were predominately in the fly ash.

The cathodic active material (LiCoO2) collected from spent Li-ion batteries (LIBs) is dissolved in mild organic acids, iminodiacetic acid (IDA) and maleic acid (MA), to recover the metals. Almost complete dissolution occurred in slightly excess (than the stoichiometric requirement) of IDA or MA at 80Â°C for 6h, based on the Co and Li released. The reducing agent, ascorbic acid (AA), converts the dissolved Co(III)- to Co(II)-L (L=IDA or MA) thereby selective recovery of Co as Co(II)-oxalate is possible. The formation of Co(III)- and Co(II)-L is evident from the UVâ€“Vis spectra of the dissolved solution as a function of dissolution time.

The electrical and thermal properties of tin-phosphate materials were investigated by electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and thermogravimetry â€“ differential thermal analysis â€“ mass spectroscopy (TGâ€“DTAâ€“MS). Moreover, the local structure of xSnP was characterized by 119Sn-MÃ¶ssbauer and magic angle spinning (MAS) 31P NMR spectroscopies. Homogeneous glasses were obtained for xSnP with â€˜xâ€™ from 50 to 80, while Sn(HPO4), SnO2, and Sn3(PO4)2 nanoparticles formed in 40SnP and 90SnP compositions, respectively. The nano-crystallized 40SnP and 90SnP samples showed large electrical conductivity (Ïƒ) of 2.02Ã—10âˆ’5 and 1.04Ã—10âˆ’4 S cmâˆ’1 due to the conductive crystalline phases of SnP2O7 and defective SnO2, respectively. The lower Ïƒ of about 10âˆ’8 S cmâˆ’1 were recorded for xSnP with â€˜xâ€™ from 50 to 80 owing to the decomposition of the 3D network built by phosphate tetrahedrons. 119Sn-MÃ¶ssbauer spectra proved the growing number of SnIVO6 units, which do not contribute to the rise of electrical conductivity. On the other hand, larger Ïƒ values of 1.79Ã—10âˆ’4 and 6.4Ã—10âˆ’3 S cmâˆ’1 were confirmed for 40SnP and 90SnP samples after heat treatment, resulting in partial reduction of SnIV to SnII and growing of the 3D network structure by PO4 3âˆ’. It is concluded that highly electrically conductive xSnP samples can be synthesized by the sol-gel method followed by slow heat treatment. In addition, the battery evaluation was performed of xSnP samples as cathode and anode in a sodium-ion battery.

The process comprises an acid leaching followed by the resynthesis of a cathode material from the resulting leachate. Spent cathode materials were leached in citric acid (C6H8O7) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Optimal leaching conditions were obtained at a leaching temperature of 90 Â°C, a H2O2 concentration of 1.5â€¯vol%, a leaching time of 60 min, a pulp density of 20â€¯gâ€¯Lâˆ’1, and a citric acid concentration of 0.5â€¯M. The leaching efficiencies of Li, Co, Ni, and Mn exceeded 95%. The leachate was used to resynthesize new LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 material by using a solâ€“gel method. A comparison of the electrochemical properties of the resynthesized material (NCM-spent) with that synthesized directly from original chemicals (NCM-syn) indicated that the initial discharge capacity of NCM-spent at 0.2â€¯C was 152.8â€¯mAâ€¯hâ€¯gâˆ’1, which was higher than the 149.8â€¯mAâ€¯hâ€¯gâˆ’1 of NCM-syn.

In Indonesia, the risk of exposure is high due to the inappropriate recycling of used lead batteries. The objective was to investigate the factors that influence lead levels in children's blood. Methods This cross-sectional study assessed blood lead levels (BLLs) in children aged 12â€“59 months in four communities exposed to used lead-acid batteries (ULABs) recycling activities, comparing them to a control area. The study employed a threshold level of 20 Î¼g/dL to identify high BLLs and utilized a sample size of 324 children from exposed sites and 240 from control sites. Questionnaires, blood lead tests and a home-based assessment for environmental exposures were applied. Results The study participants comprised 295 boys and 269 girls, with an average age of 35 months. Significant disparities in soil lead concentrations median: Q1-Q3 were found between exposed (6581.7 : 2432.6â€“16647.1) ppm and control areas (253.5 : 158.8â€“417.1) ppm. Children in exposed areas had 3.9 times higher odds of BLL â‰¥20 Î¼g/dL. Fathers with BLL â‰¥20 Î¼g/dL had children with similarly elevated BLLs. Multivariate analysis identified socioeconomic status, study areas, environmental factors (cookware, food ware, spices, house cleaning), and children's behavior (breastfeeding duration) as determinants of elevated BLLs. Reported environmental factors had notable impact on BLLs, with aluminum cookware (aOR = 1.4, 95%CI [1.2â€“1.6]), food ware materials (aOR = 1.15, 95%CI [1.0â€“1.3]), type of spices (aOR = 2.7, 95%CI [1.7â€“48.0]), and house cleaning method (aOR = 2.9, 95%CI [1.2â€“7.1]). Conclusion This study highlighted key risk factors affecting children's blood lead levels (BLL) and emphasized the urgency of employing effective strategies to remediate lead-contaminated soils in exposed regions.

After sulfation roasting (acid-to-lithium molar ratio ( n H 2 SO 4 : n Li ) = 0.95, 550 Â°C and 3 h), the roasted products were subject to the 1st stage of water leaching. Under optimum conditions (30 Â°C, 2 h and liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio of 4 mL/g), the extraction of Li and Mn reached 90% and 10%, whereas extractions of Co and Ni were negligible. The water leaching residues were then treated by the 2nd stage of acidic leaching (2 mol/L H2SO4 solution with L/S ratio of 5 mL/g at 60 Â°C for 2 h) which resulted in an additional 98% Ni, 97% Co and 90% Mn being leached from the residue. An investigation of the phase transformation mechanism indicated that the extraction behaviors of valuable metals might be induced by the different reduction pathways of the metals while controlling the roasting conditions. With roasting temperature <550 Â°C and roasting time <2 h, Li within the crystalline LiCoxNiyMn1-x-yO2 was de-intercalated and transformed to soluble Li2SO4, while Ni, Co and Mn in the LiCoxNiyMn1-x-yO2 decomposed to MnCo2O4 and Ni6MnO8 because of the co-existence of sulfuric acid and carbon reductant from the graphite anode material.

Elemental copper was found to be a less efficient reducing agent (78%) compared to aluminum (100%) in terms of Fe3+ reduced to Fe2+. Nevertheless, copper exhibited much higher rate of iron reduction than aluminum. Additionally, aqueous copper ions were found to cement on aluminum surface and redissolve in the presence of iron, thus acting as the metallic reducing agent.

Thus, the extraction of these metals from spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has gained much attention since they are present in relatively high concentrations in the cathode of the battery. Chlorination roasting is an attractive technique of metal extraction because of its salient features: short reaction times and moderate reaction temperatures, selectivity to the extraction of certain metals and in many cases implies the use of low-cost chlorinating reactants. However, there are few studies concerning the recycling of metals through chlorination roasting. This research paper evaluates the chlorination roasting using MgCl2Â·6H2O as chlorinating reactant followed by water-leaching to recycle lithium and cobalt from the cathode material of spent LIBs. First, a non-isothermal chlorination test between 20 and 900 Â°C was performed to evaluate how temperature affects the chlorination of the metals and the presence of impurities. Then, isothermal chlorination tests at 420, 440 and 470 Â°C for times between 60 and 350 min were performed to evaluate the effect of time on the purity of the product. It was found that the chlorination treatment is selective to lithium. HCl(g) generated during the decomposition of MgCl2Â·6H2O reacts with lithium to produce LiCl.

Simultaneously, it addresses the growing demand for high-performance anode materials by leveraging renewable waste feedstocks. Sugarcane bagasse waste residues obtained after furfural extraction were used as the precursor. The furfural-derived bagasse residue (FDBR) underwent pyrolysis at 700 Â°C to produce a carbon-rich char, which was further activated using KOH and steam at 900 Â°C for 15â€“60â€¯minutes to enhance porosity development. Comprehensive physicochemical characterizations, including proximate analysis, N2 adsorption-desorption, SEM-EDX, FTIR, and TGA/DTG, and Raman spectroscopy were performed to evaluate the properties of the synthesized activated carbons. The results demonstrated the successful generation of high surface area (405.8â€¯m2/g) activated carbons with a hierarchical pore structure comprising micropores and mesopores. SEM and EDX analyses revealed a uniform, porous morphology enriched with 10.41â€¯% at oxygen-containing functional groups. FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of hydroxyls, carbonyls, and carboxylic acid groups, beneficial for pseudocapacitive charge storage. The Raman analysis revealed a highly disordered and amorphous carbon structure with a significant concentration of defects, as evidenced by a high-intensity ratio (ID/IG â‰ˆ 1.2â€“1.4) of the disordered carbon band to the graphitic band. The activated carbons exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 1055â€¯mAh/g in lithium half-cells, significantly exceeding the theoretical limit of commercial graphite anodes (372â€¯mAh/g). This superior capacity was attributed to the high surface area, hierarchical porosity, and pseudocapacitive contributions from the oxygen functionalities. However, rapid capacity fading from 1055 to âˆ¼250â€¯mAh/g was observed over 100 cycles at a C/2 rate. The capacity retention stabilized at âˆ¼88â€¯% after 47 cycles, indicating irreversible capacity losses. These limitations were ascribed to the disordered amorphous structure, instability of the solid-electrolyte interphase, lithium trapping by oxygen groups, and structural changes during cycling. Optimizing activation conditions, incorporating conductive additives/coatings, exploring alternative binders, and surface functionalization are proposed to improve long-term cycling stability.

Both in terms of economic value and environmental protection, the recycling and regeneration of the spent lithium batteries is extremely urgent. Herein, a green and efficient hydrothermal technique for direct regeneration of spent lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4 or LFP) was proposed. LFP loses the partial lithium during the long cycle and converts to FePO4 (FP), therefore, the replacement of the lost lithium is crucial for the regeneration of spent LFP. Herein, the effects of hydrothermal conditions such as reaction temperature, Li+ concentration and reducing agent concentration on the performance of product are systemically studied. Besides, it has been found that the control of hydrothermal condition is conductive to the supplement of Li and the enhancement of electrochemical performance of the product.

In recent times, the lithium-titanate (LTO) anode material has gained attention due to a higher surface area (100 m2/g) than the usual graphite-made anode (3 m2/g). The development of a new recycling strategy, in particular, to deal with spent LTO batteries, is therefore urgently needed as plenty of batteries deployed in electric vehicles are near to completing their lifespan. Herein, we demonstrate the recycling of spent LTO batteries by optimizing the parametric influence of H2SO4 concentration, H2O2 dosage, agitation speed, temperature, and time for lithium and titanium leaching from the anode material. About 92% titanium and 98% lithium were efficiently leached from the anode powder using a 3.5 mol/L H2SO4 solution with 25 vol% H2O2 at a pulp density of 5 wt./vol.%, temperature 120 Â°C, and time 120 min. The leaching examined in the temperature range between 60 Â°C and 120 Â°C with respect to time showed the best fits to the kinetic model governed by the logarithmic rate law. The apparent activation energies of titanium (78.9 kJ/mole) and lithium (11.3 kJ/mole) indicated two different mechanisms governed by chemically controlled and diffusion-controlled reactions, respectively. It indicated that both metalsâ€™ leaching proceeded through lixiviant diffusion on the LTO surface, which was corroborated by the instrumental analyses of the untreated LTO sample and the leached residues.

The dissolution of lithium is faster than that for nickel, cobalt and manganese. Data analysis demonstrated that NMC dissolution is always a two-step process. In the first step, NMC was transformed very quickly into a new lithium-defficient phase. This phase was subsequently dissolved during a second-rate limiting step. No significant impact of the solid/liquid ratio on the leaching kinetics was observed as far as the solid-liquid ratio remained below the stochiometric composition.

Moreover, after 50 cycles, the discharge capacity is 325.5mAhgâˆ’1, and the capacity retention is about 97.5%. The two conditions tested for rate capability are as follows: First, a charge at 0.2C rate and discharge at variable C-rates in which the unburned carbon after heat treatment at higher temperature exhibits a higher capacity in the 0.2â€“3C region. However, unburned carbon with heat treatment at 2300Â°C is a suitable material for the higher C-rate region (5â€“10C). Second, for both charge and discharge at the same C-rate, the unburned carbon after heat treatment at higher temperature exhibits a higher capacity in the 0.2â€“0.5C region; however, unburned carbon without graphitization treatment is a suitable material for the higher C-rate region (3â€“10C). Based on TEM observations, the graphitization treatment samples had annular microstructure which has many active sites, improving the intercalation/deintercalation of lithium ions. Therefore, these results show that compared to natural graphite, graphitization of unburned carbon is more suitable for the anode materials of a high power battery.",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),leaching process,"acid leaching, solvent extraction, alkaline leaching, HCl leaching, pulping, and calcination",NA,NA

Two types of alkaline batteries were used: Super Hyper UM-3SHSL8P6 (SH) and Alkaline LR6XAB/4B192 (AK), which were calcined at 500 Â°C for 4 h. The materials underwent various characterization tests, including SEM, XRF, BET, DRS, TGA, DRX, and pH at the Isoelectric Point (pI).

This optimal condition was validated experimentally and statistically. In recycling tests, the photocatalysts maintained their efficiency until the third cycle with no statistically significant differences. The toxicity test with Lactuca sativa (lettuce) seeds showed that the treated water was not toxic.

The branched structure of p-TPPZ led to a larger specific surface area than that of p-DPPZ, which was beneficial for the electrolyte infiltration and fast ionic transport, contributing to the high power density. Due to the fast reaction kinetics, even at a power density of 23,725 W kgâ€“1 (40 C), the energy density still reached 474.5 Wh kgâ€“1.

Characterization results showed that surface oxygen, i.e., chemically adsorbed oxygen and surficial lattice oxygen, only acted as benzene adsorption sites inert towards benzene oxidation whereas bulk lattice oxygen was reactive for oxidation reaction. Water treatment played two roles in updating the LiCoO2 surface properties. One was to remove the excessive Li2CO3 and the thus-generated sites could adsorb gaseous oxygen, which was catalyzed to directly oxidize the gas-phase benzene into surface by-products at low temperatures (150âˆ’200 Â°C) following the Elay-Rideal pathway.

In this work, a novel method of NH4HSO4 reduction roasting-selective ammonia leaching was proposed to thoroughly separate Li and Mn from the spent LiMn2O4 cathode materials. Using the TG-DSC-FTIR, XRD, SEM-EDS and ICP methods, the detailed mechanism of reduction roasting process was revealed, showing that the Mn4+ and Mn3+ in the spinel structure of LiMn2O4 were reduced by the NH4 + from the molten ammonium salt, and transformed into water-soluble MnSO4 and Li2Mn2(SO4)3. According to the water-leaching performance of the roasting products, the sulfation conversion rate of Mn reaches 98.1 %, while Li is almost completely transformed under the optimal roasting conditions (475 â„ƒ, 60 min).

The investigated process variables include reductive agent concentrations (Fe2+, Cu, H2O2) as well as process temperature, whereas S/L ratio (200 g/L) and initial acidity (2 M H2SO4) were kept constant. At lower temperatures (T = 30 Â°C), copper was found to act as the predominant reductant, enabled by the presence of sufficient solution iron concentrations (â‰¥0.4 g/L Fe). Conversely, at higher temperatures (T â‰¥ 50 Â°C), the reductive capability of aluminum was substantially increased due to its decreased tendency for passivation.

This work represents the first study to explore TP waste composed of low-density polyethylene (LDPE)/aluminum (Al) components for energy storage applications. The LDPE part serves as a matrix conserving a material in a compact, solid shape after PW melting; PW acts as an active phase change component contributing to heat absorption/release through a phase change (from a solid to a liquid state, and vice versa) of its crystalline phase. EG serves as a filler that enhances the thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of materials. The focus was put on the optimization of the composition of SSPCM including PW, and EG, to check thermal, mechanical, and rheological properties which influence the future processability of such systems through extrusion, as well as to investigate the synergic effect of graphite and residual Al component on thermal conductivity and leakage of PW. There are two main demands on polymer/PW blends, namely well-separated melting peaks for both components at significantly different temperatures, and good compatibility between polymer and PW. The best performance of SSPCM investigated in this study was found for a mixture having the composition TP/PW/EG = 50/40/10 w/w/w. This mixture shows well-balanced properties, including appropriate heat storage and release parameters, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, toughness and strength, and low leakage of PW from the material. This system can store 116.2 J/g of heat energy and release 93.8 J/g of heat energy. The determination of the heat energy storage and release was performed by the transient guarded hot plate technique. Tensile testing revealed that Young's modulus of the TP/PW/EG = 50/40/10 w/w/w composition was 924 Â± 71 MPa and the stress at break was 8.2 Â± 1.2 MPa, which are sufficient values from the applicability point of view.

However, FPCMs based on high thermal conductivity fillers and polymers always suffer from the enduring challenges of poor high-temperature resistance and poor filler-matrix compatibility. To solve these problems, a novel strategy is reported in this work, wherein FPCMs with excellent filler-matrix compatibility and satisfactory high-temperature resistance are synthesized by two steps: functionalizing the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) surface and inducing the inter crosslinking between Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene(SBS) and Low-density polyethylene(LDPE). Vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) molecules were introduced on the surface of raw hBN by hydroxylation and silanization surface modification to improve the compatibility of hBN with the matrix. Concluding from the results, the addition of 6.7 wt% LDPE doubled the high-temperature resistance of FPCMs, enabling them to maintain their structural integrity even at 200 Â°C for 1 h.

It still suffers the sore points of easy electrode collapse due to large volume expansion during charge and discharge and low active materials utilization caused by the severe shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Therefore, in this work, ramie gum (RG) was extracted from ramie fiber degumming liquid and used as the functional binder to address the above problems and improve the Li-S battery's performance for the first time. Surprisingly, the sulfur cathode using RG binder illustrates a high initial capacity of 1152.2 mAh/g, and a reversible capacity of 644.6 mAh/g after 500 cycles at 0.5 C, far better than the sulfur cathode using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder. More importantly, even if the active materials loading increased to as high as 4.30 mg/cm2, the area capacity is still around 3.1 mAh/cm2 after 200 cycles.

In this work, the effects of incineration on the leaching efficiency of metals from EV LIBs were evaluated. The thermal process was applied as a pre-treatment for the electrode material, aiming for carbothermic reduction of the valuable metals by the graphite contained in the waste. Leaching efficiencies above 70% were obtained for Li, Mn, Ni and Co after 60 min of leaching even when using 0.5 M sulfuric acid, which can be linked to the formation of more easily leachable compounds during the incineration process. When the incineration temperature was increased (600â€“700 Â°C), the intensity of graphite signals decreased and other oxides were identified, possibly due to the increase in oxidative conditions. Higher leaching efficiencies of Mn, Ni, Co, and Li were reached at lower temperatures of incineration (400â€“500 Â°C) and at higher leaching times, which could be related to the partial carbothermic reduction of the metals.",Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical approaches,"leaching efficiencies above 70%, 0.5 M sulfuric acid, 600â€“700 Â°C, 400â€“500 Â°C",NA,700

Typically, an Li source is required to address the vacant Li defects in spent cathodes for regeneration, while the removal of residual Li is crucial for regenerating spent anodes. Here, given our discovery that approximately 65 % of the residual Li in spent graphite demonstrates reactivity with water, we propose a straightforward water extraction method for purifying and regenerating spent graphite anode. By carefully controlling the concentrations of OH- and Li+ ions in the obtained Li-rich solution, it can be directly used to relithiate spent NCM cathodes. In this method, Li+ ions lost from the cathode during electrochemical cycling were reintroduced back into the cathode via aqueous relithiation, eliminating the need for additional Li sources to repair the Li deficiencies in spent cathode, effectively reducing recycling costs and minimizing the environmental impact associated with raw materials. The regenerated NCM cathode and graphite anode demonstrated specific capacities of 163 mAh/g and 386 mAh/g at a rate of 0.1C, respectively, both reaching the performance levels of pristine materials.

However, the performance of short-process regenerated electrode materials is generally difficult to comparable with the commercial materials, especially for lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM). Herein, antimony (Sb) doping, and modification is proposed to boost the performance enhancement of short-process regenerated NCM in our work. Spent NCM is first selectively leached by oxalic acid, and then directly dried to obtain the precursor without separation and filtration. Finally, NCM is regenerated by lithium supplement and Sb doping modification. The regenerated NCM with optimal Sb doping modification (R-Sb10) has better electrochemical performance and cycle stability. It delivers an initial specific discharge capacity of 152.3 mAh/g, and the capacity retention maintains 86.3 % after 200 cycles at 0.5C, which can be comparable to the commercial NCM. The Sb element can be evenly distributed in the interior of short-process regenerated NCM, especially with a protective Li3SbO4 film on the surface.

The W-LFP is successfully regenerated via heat treatment with the addition of Li2CO3, CNTs and glucose. After activation, the dispersibility of CNTs in water is improved, making it easier to mix well with other materials. Also, the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on CNTs have a certain degree of reducibility, which is conducive to the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+. After subsequent heat treatment, the three-dimensional conductive network composed of CNTs greatly enhances the conductivity and the ionic diffusion coefficient of LFP, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. Meanwhile, the decay and regeneration mechanisms of LFP are investigated by characterization and electrochemical testing. The regenerated LFP achieves an excellent specific capacity of 155.47 mAh/g at 0.05 C, which is around 99% that of new LFP.

The variations of the recycling performance have been documented in many studies. The main mechanism of delamination is the inactivation of bonding forces provided by the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. It is believed that the storage environment (air exposure time) will affect the performances of delamination to some extent. Three representative methods (direct calcination, pressure washing, and NMP solvent extraction) for delamination were studied to elucidate the effect of air exposure time on delamination efficiency. The peel-off efficiency (98â€“99%) of the direct calcination method was barely influenced by air exposure time. The pressure washing system or NMP solvent extraction method also exhibited high peel-off efficiency using samples after a long air exposure time (1 month), however these methods may have problems regarding Al contamination, i.e., 11.5 mg/g of pressure washing system and 134.4 mg/g of NMP solvent extraction. Results suggest that enhanced adhesion (0.11 MPa/month) could be a potential reason why air contact time affects delamination, with O2 and/or H2O acting as contributors.

As EV sales gain market-share, the demand for batteries is growing very rapidly, and this has raised concerns about the raw-material supply. Therefore, efficient and environmentally friendly recycling methods for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are mandatory to properly implement circular economy paradigms in this field. Hydrometallurgical recycling methods are characterized by their selectivity, high product purity as well as low energy consumption. In order to accomplish a close-loop recycling method, in this work we propose the use of a deep eutectic solvent (DES) and alginate hydrogels as leaching reagent and adsorbent, respectively, for their reusability, availability and biodegradability.

Electrochemical technology is emerging as an environmentally friendly approach for selectively extracting lithium from discarded cathode materials, garnering significant attention. However, the lack of a clear understanding of the structural evolution during the de-lithiation process, and the re-lithiation mechanism of transition-metal oxides after lithium extraction, hinder the direct regeneration of de-lithiated materials into battery-worthy materials. This limitation also impeds the further advancement of this promising technology. Here, for the first time the structural transformation associated with water-molecule intercalation during the electrochemical process of spent layer material (LiNi0.55Co0.15Mn0.3O2) is demonstrated. X-ray diffraction technique monitors the structural evolution upon de-lithiation, revealing an unusual phase transformation from H3 to â€œH4â€ driven by water-molecule intercalation. This transformation triggers significant lattice expansion along c-axis and introduces notable lattice distortion in de-lithiated material. These characteristics render direct calcination for material regeneration impractical, due to lattice collapse from dehydration, obstructing lithium intercalation at high temperatures. Interestingly, low-temperature calcination can endow resynthesized materials with a well-ordered layer structure after creating a lithium-water-balance layer structure for de-lithiated materials by hydrothermal process.

For such purpose, the design and synthesis of a new crown ether-bearing monomer, namely 2-(benzo-12-crown-4-ether)ethyl methacrylamide (BCEEM), its copolymerization with N-isopropylacrylamide (NiPAAm) and its adsorption properties were studied. While crown ethers (CEs) are well known for their metal adsorption properties, NiPAAm brought thermoresponsive properties to the copolymer, allowing for sorption at certain temperatures, and great processability through precipitation at other temperatures. With varied BCEEM/NiPAAm ratios, Lower Critical Solution Temperatures (LCST) ranged from 6 to 26.5 Â°C. Regarding the sorption performances by the CEs, several parameters were varied, such as pH, temperature and Li/CE ratio. Under optimized experimental conditions, the lithium sorption isotherm highlighted a maximum adsorption capacity of 0.075 mmol/g polymer (0.55 mg.gâˆ’1), which is in the lower limit compared to similar CE studies reported in the literature. Moreover, competitive sorption studied in multicomponent solutions (Li, Co, Ni, Mn) simulating lithium-ion batteries (LIB) leachates (containing mostly lithium and cobalt), as well as in solutions with increased amounts of nickel and manganese, showed that selectivity towards lithium (and to a lesser extent cobalt) appeared to depend on the relative concentration of these two elements compared to Ni and Mn. In leachate-like conditions, the copolymer showed selectivity towards Li and Co whereas the selectivity evolved towards Ni and Mn as the initial concentration of Ni and Mn increased. DLS and ITC measurements were undergone to comprehend the obtained sorption capacities and selectivity from a mechanistic and thermodynamic point of view.

In this study, micro-expanded graphite (MEG) was synthesized by one-step oxidation method using waste LIBs anode graphite as material and perchloric acid as intercalation and oxidant agent. Then, its performance as a LIBs anode material were investigated as well as the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the whole process were calculated. Perchloric acid was successfully embedded in the SG during the reaction, which effectively removed the impurities in the graphite. Defects introduced during intercalation and delamination, such as nanopores and intercrystalline cracks. Both provide additional space for Li ions during charging and discharging, thereby promoting capacity enhancement. The prepared MEG expresses a rate capability as high as 340.32 mAh/g at a current density of 0.1 C and still retains 81.73% of the capacity after 100 cycles at a current density of 1 C.

Here, we report an energy-saving pre-treatment process that can increase the metals leaching efficiency of spent LiNi x Co y Mn1âˆ’ x âˆ’ y O2 LIBs in H2SO4 solution. In the proposed process, the spent electrode material was calcined in a nitrogen (oxygen-free) atmosphere, resulting in the easy leaching of metals by H2SO4 without adding reductant. Calcination conditions were examined, and calcination at 350 Â°C for 1.5 h resulted in the optimal leaching rates of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn (>99%). Mechanism analysis revealed how calcination improves the leaching efficiency. We found the proposed calcination pre-treatment can destroy the well-defined layered crystal structure of spent LiNi x Co y Mn1âˆ’ x âˆ’ y O2 without changing its original phase composition. As a result, refinement of crystalline size, increase of defect, amorphization, and specific surface area (with the emergence of cracks and voids) of the cathode particles enhance the leaching of metals.

This work proposes a coupled dynamic bond (CDB) strategy using an ionomer-metal ion-ligand pair, which complements the orthogonal dynamic bonding strategy. It involves the in situ polymerization of acrylic acid (the counter ion) into poly(acrylic acid), resulting in the formation of a second ionic network on the first zinc-imidazole network. The integration of CDBs effectively enhances the stiffness of the material, without affecting its stretchability and strength. The newly synthesized material exhibits well-balanced mechanical properties, with Youngâ€™s modulus, strength, and toughness of 109 MPa, 32 MPa, and 242 MJmâˆ’3, respectively. The Youngâ€™s modulus and yield strength of double network material are 137% and 100% higher, respectively than those of the material with a metal-coordination single network.

High-Purity Water (HPW), acidic (pH 4) and alkaline (pH 12) conditions were used in order to observe the behavior of primary solid phases as well as the constituent elements (Mn, Mg, Al, Si, Ca). The experiments were coupled with both KINDIS(P) modeling and mineralogical study (SEM-EDS). Experimental results showed that the Mn-rich slag was sensitive to acidic conditions which induced the dissolution of primary phases. Moreover, pH 4 conditions did not result in the formation of newly formed solid products, leading to the greatest mobilization of metallic elements (especially Mn). Alkaline conditions favored the precipitation of secondary phases, especially rhodochrosite, calcite and Mg-saponite, inducing low mobilization of the contained elements. The KINDIS(P) modeling allowed the stability of primary phases and newly formed products to be predicted. Although the modeled results have to be considered with caution, they allow the assessment and understanding of future environmental behavior of the solid material in given conditions.

Although featuring with simplified process, direct regeneration technology still fails to bypass high-temperature driving forces for Li+ compensation of degraded cathodes. Herein, chemical re-lithiation strategy mediated by ferrocene is proposed to directly regenerate the Li-deficient spent cathodes. Ferrocene and its derivatives, the so-called p-type redox mediators, can be oxidized spontaneously from neutral molecules to stable cations under ambient conditions, allowing them to function as electron donors. Meanwhile, lithium salts serve as Li+ donors to ensure charge neutrality of the cathode lattice. The effects of solvation and substituent are thoroughly investigated to precisely regulate the potential of a series of ferrocene-based reductants. Chemical re-lithiation is driven thermodynamically by the intrinsic potential gap between ferrocene and degraded cathodes, thus fundamentally realizing a rapid lithiation reaction (taking less than 20 min at 25 Â°C), while avoiding the involvement of high-temperature operation. Diverse characterizations have been performed to explore the Li+-electron concerted re-lithiation mechanism. The regenerated LiFePO4 cathode demonstrated comparable Li+ storage capability to commercial cathode. Life-cycle analysis verifies the economical and environmental superiority of our chemical re-lithiation strategy to metallurgy in practical industry.

Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a highly promising energy storage solution due to their promising performance over a wide range of temperatures and the abundance of sodium resources in the earth's crust. Compared to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), although sodium ions possess a larger ionic radius, they are more easily desolvated than lithium ions. Furthermore, SIBs have a smaller Stokes radius than lithium ions, resulting in improved sodium-ion mobility in the electrolyte. Nevertheless, SIBs demonstrate a significant decrease in performance at low temperatures (LT), which constrains their operation in harsh weather conditions. Despite the increasing interest in SIBs, there is a notable scarcity of research focusing specifically on their mechanism under LT conditions. This review explores recent research that considers the thermal tolerance of SIBs from an inner chemistry process perspective, spanning a wide temperature spectrum (âˆ’70 to 100 Â°C), particularly at LT conditions. In addition, the enhancement of electrochemical performance in LT SIBs is based on improvements in reaction kinetics and cycling stability achieved through the utilization of effective electrode materials and electrolyte components. Furthermore, the safety concerns associated with SIBs are addressed and effective strategies are proposed for mitigating these issues.

The relationship and mechanisms between the generation of different types of Mo-based nanocrystals and the annealing temperature were systematically explored. It was found that MoO2 nanocrystals were formed when the annealing temperature was 580 Â°C. With the temperature increasing, Mo2N nanocrystals began to form due to the reaction between the formed MoO2 and the N atoms in the PAN macromolecules. At higher temperature like 669 Â°C, Mo2C nanocrystals started to form due to the reaction between Mo2N and C atoms in the carbonized PAN macromolecules, and single-phase Mo2C nanocrystals were produced in CNFs at 900 ÂºC. Then, a series of flexible CNF-based nanocomposite membranes embedded with various different types of Mo-based compound nanocrystals were generated by effectively controlling the annealing temperature, which were all utilized as anodes for the construction of lithium-ion batteries. Electrochemical measurements showed that the anode materials annealed at 600 oC possessed the highest specific capacity, which were due to the high theoretical specific capacity of MoO2 and significantly improved conductivity of Mo2N. Moreover, all the as-developed electrodes exhibited excellent cycling stability during the charge-discharge process.

The as-synthesized hard carbon reveals a high specific surface area (820 m2 gâˆ’1) with the hierarchical porous structure. In order to overcome poor initial coulombic efficiency in the first cycle, we use environmental-friendly water-based carboxymethyl cellulose with styrene butadiene rubber (CMC/SBR) binder instead of organic-based poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF).

The regeneration of spent graphite was done via acetic acid treatment, and the graphite/metal oxide composite was prepared by an ultrasonication route. The structural properties of the as-prepared composite materials are effectively influenced by the introduction of TiO2 and MnO2 particles as evidenced by the variation in the intensity of the diffraction peaks and the appearance of new peaks. The decoration of graphite flakes with metal oxide particles is demonstrated by morphological and mapping analysis. The optimum concentration of MnO2 particles is found to be 10 wt% in a graphite framework and results in good functional properties when compared with RG and a TiO2/RG composite. Finally, the optimized 10 wt% MnO2/RG composite displays excellent charge storage of 184 F/g in 1 M KOH electrolyte, which is greater than for the other graphite composite samples. The impact of MnO2 productively contributes to the excellent capacitance of graphite, which is due to greater grain conductivity, thus reducing the charge transfer resistance and providing a large contact area for storage of ions.

Sulfuric acid treatment and subsequent pyrolysis of the masks resulted in polyaromatic and carbon structures, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies revealed that a longer sulfuric acid treatment time results in a higher carbon yield (up to 50%), indicating that the infusible structures generated during sulfonation played a critical role in the development of the resulting carbon. In addition, we confirmed the detailed mechanism by NMR analysis, which indicated that sulfonation induced not only simple cross-linking but also polyaromatic hydrocarbons, contributing to distinct D and G bands in the Raman spectra.

As the cost of extracting Li from brine is typically 30â€“50% lower than conventional hard-rock sources, this work intends to critically analyze the evolution of direct lithium extraction (DLE) methods employed in Salt Lake brine with various magnesium/lithium (Mg/Li) mass ratios whereas the lithium brine concentration (LBC) methods seek to concentrate the Li brine and eliminate contaminants without isolating the Li from the brine. Solvent extraction, precipitation, adsorption, membrane technology, and electrochemical extraction are the developed methods for Li extraction from Salt Lake brine. This review focuses on the mechanism, workflow, and comparative analysis of different methods. Moreover, recent technological advancements to handle the high Mg/Li ratio, such as modification of adsorption using ion sieves, liquid-membrane electrodialysis, and efficient multicomponent doping electrode materials, have also been discussed in depth. Although it was previously believed that solvent extraction was only feasible for low Mg/Li ratio brines, it has recently been commercially applied for high Mg/Li ratio brines in China. Precipitation is more ecology-friendly and economically favorable because of its low cost. Li extraction from brines with high Mg/Li ratios also shows promising performance using aluminate (Al) precipitants and novel Mg precipitants. However, during Mg precipitation, there is a significant loss of Li. On the other hand, in the cost-effective adsorption method, aluminium salt adsorbents are industrially used, yet low adsorption capacities limit their application. Recently, ion-exchange methods have gained popularity, as â€˜Li sievesâ€™ exhibit remarkable selectivity and adsorption towards Li-ions and are effective at high Mg/Li ratios. Powdered ionic sieves have low fluidity and solution permeability despite their strong affinity and adsorption capacity. Membrane technology is promising because of the benefits of improved energy consumption, simple controls, high separation rates, and the continuity of the process, yet as an emerging technology, its commercial viability is not proven. Nevertheless, a coupled â€œadsorption-membraneâ€ technique has been developed and used in China for Salt Lake brines with low Li grades. Furthermore, exceptional selectivity, low energy demand, and minimal impact on the environment of electrochemical methods make Li extraction from brine promising. Being a recent technology, there is ample scope for improving electrode materials and understanding the process mechanism and cell configuration. Lastly, perspectives on the future Li extraction from brines are conferred in this article.
