Part 1: Lead citrate synthesis from PbO and PbO2,"In this study, as part of developing a new process which can avoid smelting and electro-winning, citric acid based reagents in aqueous media were reacted with PbO and PbO2. These two oxides are important components in the spent lead-acid battery paste and together account for up to 50% of the paste by weight. PbSO4, the main component in a spent battery paste accounting for the remaining 50%, is dealt with in Part 2 in a separate paper. Reaction between PbO and C6H8O7·H2O or PbO2 with a mixture of C6H8O7·H2O and H2O2 yielded lead citrate, Pb(C6H6O7)·H2O, which was characterised by XRD, SEM and FT-IR analysis. Optimal synthesis conditions were determined by investigating the effect of time, temperature, concentration, and the starting Pb oxide/water ratio. The optimal condition for leaching a mol of PbO at room temperature (20 °C) was found to be: 1 mol of (C6H8O7)·H2O solution; 1/3 as the starting PbO/water ratio and 15 min of reaction time. Pure citrate product, Pb(C6H6O7)·H2O was rapidly crystallized from the solution, in the leaching process. Leaching of PbO2 required the use of a mild reducing agent. For each mole of PbO2, the optimum condition at 20 °C was found to be: a solution containing 4 mol of C6H8O7·H2O and 2 mol of H2O2; 1/5 as the starting solid PbO2/water ratio; and 60 min of reaction time. The product, as with PbO, was pure Pb(C6H6O7)·H2O compound. The remaining lead content of the filtrate solution was 0.017% and 1% corresponding to recoveries of 99.98% and 99% of lead as citrate, after the leaching/crystallization/filtration process with PbO and PbO2, respectively. Asymmetric stretching vibrations between 1599 and 1662 cm−1, whereas symmetric vibrations between 1520 and 1327 cm−1 for lead citrate synthesised from PbO and asymmetric stretching vibrations between 1600 and 1642 cm−1 as well as symmetric vibrations between 1517 and 1326 cm−1 for the product obtained from PbO2 revealed the strong IR adsorptions associated with a carboxylate structure. XRD data was identical to the well documented crystalline Pb(C6H6O7)·H2O compound from both the oxides. SEM revealed the formation of plate/sheet like morphologies. The difference in the column size of the Pb(C6H6O7)·H2O formed from the two lead oxides can be related to difference in the rate of the respective reactions.","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['PbO', 'PbO2', 'Lead Acid Battery'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['XRD', 'SEM and FT-IR analysis', 'leaching', 'crystallization', 'filtration'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['20 °C', 'reaction time: 15 min'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['Lead Citrate', 'Pb(C6H6O7)·H2O']}","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['lithium-ion batteries'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['leaching process'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['temperature: 80 °C', 'pH: 1.5', 'and leaching time: 30 min'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['Li2CO3']}

1,10.1016/j.ceja.2023.100582,Recovery of NixMnyCoz(OH)2 and Li2CO3 from spent Li-ionB cathode leachates using non-Na precipitant-based chemical precipitation for sustainable recycling,"The interest in recycling spent lithium-ion batteries (Li-ionB) has surged due to the rising demand for valuable metals (e.g., Co, Ni, Li and Mn) and concerns about environmental repercussions emanating from conventional battery waste disposal. Conventional precipitation-based hydrometallurgy recycling processes utilise Na-based or metal-based precipitants. The Na, from Na-based precipitants, is present in high concentrations in the process effluent since they are not recovered during the recycling process. The Na-rich effluent cannot be discarded since it doesn't meet environmental regulations as per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (2023) therefore creating a storage and disposal problem. It is therefore imperative to utilise non-Na-based precipitants to eliminate the effluent disposal problem. This paper focuses on the recovery of NixCoyMnz(OH)2 and Li2CO3, main precursors for Li-ionB cathode production, from a typical spent Li-ionB cathode (NMC 532) using non-Na precipitant-based chemical precipitation. This study reports NixCoyMnz(OH)2 and Li2CO3 recovery from spent Li-ionBs for closed-loop Li-ionB cathode recycling through an integrated hydrometallurgy and chemical precipitation process. Through the utilisation of leachate solutions comprising 2 M H2SO4 + 6 vol.% H2O2, and a 75 g/L S/L ratio and conducting leaching for 120 min at a temperature of 60 °C and IS of 350 rpm, the recovery efficiency of 98.1 % for Li, 97.1 % for Co, 96.1 % for Ni, and 95.7 % for Mn. The pH of the NMC leachate was initially adjusted to 5 to precipitate Fe, Al and Cu impurities. Thereafter, active metal species (Ni, Mn and Co) were precipitated at a pH of 13 as Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3(OH)2 composite microparticles by adding LiOH precipitant. Thereafter, the Li-rich resultant liquor was further used to recover the Li by adding 3.4 mol of CO2 bubbled at 0.068 mol (CO2)/L.min and 40 °C for 45 min. The Li2CO3 precipitates were separated from the suspension through filtration followed by washing using deionised water and hot air drying. The reaction time is 45 mins, and the agitation speed is 150 rpm. Through this multi-stage precipitation process, >98 % of Ni, Co, Mn and > 91 % of Li can be recovered in the form of Ni0.5Mn0.3Co0.2(OH)2 and Li2CO3 respectively. The process exhibits great potential for recovery of valuable materials from spent Li-ionBs. The recovered Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3(OH)2 and Li2CO3 materials will be used as precursors in the anhydrous NMC cathode production process.","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['Precipitation-based hydrometallurgy'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['60 °C', 'reaction time: 120 min', '350 rpm IS'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['NixCoyMnz(OH)2', 'Li2CO3']}","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['Lithium-ion batteries (Li-ionB)'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['leaching-solvent extraction-electrowinning (SX/EW)'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['2 M H2SO4 + 6 vol.% H2O2', '75 g/L S/L ratio', 'temperature of 60 °C and IS of 350 rpm', 'pH of 5', 'pH of 13', '45 min', '150 rpm'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['NixCoyMnz(OH)2 and Li2CO3']}

The recycling and utilization of spent LiFePO4 cathode materials have emerged as a new focus in the power battery industry, and have garnered widespread attention since the trend of power battery retirement continues. This article delves into the chemical transformations in the LiFePO4-NaHSO4·H2O system during roasting-water leaching to recover Li and Fe. Characterization techniques like thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) were used for analysis. The LiFePO4 and NaHSO4·H2O mixture with a 1:1.6 molar ratio exhibited significant endothermic and exothermic phenomena within the 25–600 °C temperature range. With increased roasting temperatures, elements Li, Fe, and P underwent the following chemical evolution pathways: Li: LiFePO4 → LiNaSO4 + Li3PO4 → LiNaSO4 + Li3Fe2(PO4)3 → LiNaSO4, Fe: LiFePO4 → FeSO4·H2O + Fe3(PO4)2 → Fe3(PO4)2 + Li3Fe2(PO4)3 → Li3Fe2(PO4)3 + NaFeP2O7 → NaFeP2O7 + Fe2(SO4)3, and P: LiFePO4 → Fe3(PO4)2 + Li3PO4 → Fe3(PO4)2 + Li3Fe2(PO4)3 → Li3Fe2(PO4)3 + NaFeP2O7 → NaFeP2O7. The element occurrence form in the roasting products influences the leaching rates of Li and Fe. Although the Fe leaching rate decreased from 27.64 % to 0.56 % as the roasting temperature rose from 200 to 600 °C, the Li leaching rate remained between 86.43 % and 98.40 %.","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['LiFePO4'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['roasting-water leaching'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['25 °C-600 °C'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['Li', 'Fe']}","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['Lithium-ion batteries'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['leaching-solvent extraction', 'and', 'alkaline leaching'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['alkaline solution', 'pH 12.0', 'H2SO4 concentration 2.0 mol/L', 'and', '200 °C'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['lithium and manganese']}

Nevertheless, research on the regeneration of WCR was seldom reported. Herein, a new environmentally friendly process of low-temperature fluorination roasting and water leaching technology were proposed to achieve optimal purification of WCR. And the transformation mechanism of water-soluble complex ions during fluorination roasting was investigated via DFTB indicating that the ionic bond of F and NH4 group in NH4F broken than form stable covalent bond with metal ions. This process showed that 99.59%, 99.54%, 99.82%, 96.38%, 98.41%, 97.28%, 99.23%, and 98.61% of cobalt, nickel, manganese, aluminum, silicon, iron, lithium, and sulfur in WCR could be removed under optimal conditions. Meanwhile, the high-Purity graphite carbon (PGC) products with purity of 99.98% were obtained. In particular, PGC in half-cell exhibited a stable specific capacity of 340.9 mAh/g and high ICE of 92.13%, and with a more than 96% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1C, much better performance than WCR and similarly to commercial graphite. Moreover, the discharge capacity of PGC in full-cell was 2302.82 mAh at 0.2C rate with 87.3% ICE. The capacity retention maintained at 96% after 400 cycles at 1C/1C rate. Subsequently, the valuable components in leaching solution were recovered with ammonia as precipitant. The precipitation rates of Al, Co, Mn, Ni, and Si were 99.25%, 81.74%, 98.20%, 62.43% and 86.68%, respectively. Besides, exhaust gas was absorbed in fluorine-containing leachate for recovery of ammonium fluoride products by evaporation crystallization.

4,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.140798,Sustainable regeneration of high-performance cathode materials from spent lithium-ion batteries through magnetic separation and coprecipitation,"Extensive research and application of recycling methods for spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been undertaken in recent years with great success. However, the separation of valuable metals from the lixivium of spent LIBs, which contains Al, Cu, Ni, Co, Mn, and Li, is complicated, burdensome, and unsustainable. Therefore, there is a need to establish a more sustainable and energy-efficient method for recycling spent LIBs. The study introduced an innovative methodology for replacing the impurity ion removal process in the lixivium with magnetic separation pretreatment. Then, the co-precipitation method was used to directly resynthesize LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (LNCM523) with recovered metals as raw materials. The results demonstrate that, with a magnetic field intensity of 3000 Oe and feed particle size of −0.074 mm, the magnetic separation concentrates the following grades: Ni-26.34%, Co-14.26%, Mn-28.30%, Al-0.23%, and Cu-0.41%. The corresponding recovery rates were also determined as follows: Ni-92.57%, Co-94.16%, Mn-85.68%, Al-1.62%, and Cu-2.14%. The total impurities (Al, Cu, and Fe) in the lixivium obtained by magnetic separation concentrate under conventional acid leaching conditions were below 0.05 wt%, while the contents of Ni, Co, and Mn were measured at 13.08 g/L, 7.10 g/L, and 14.06 g/L, respectively. Spherical LNCM523 was successfully regenerated from the lixivium through co-precipitation and sintering. The LNCM523 demonstrated exceptional electrochemical performance, exhibiting a notable initial discharge capacity of 173.9 mAh/g at 0.2 C and remarkable cycling stability with 91.9% retention over 100 cycles at 0.5 C. In comparison to the conventional approach, this method circumvented the intricate procedure of separating metal ions, thereby realizing the resource regeneration of cathode materials and enabling a closed-circuit recycling process.

The current pretreatment methods for spent LIBs used in industrial production are inefficient, costly, and hazardous. The study aimed to maximize the yield of lithium and cobalt from the black mass of spent Lithium-ion batteries through an optimized high-temperature thermal pretreatment process, which combined mechanical (direct crushing) and thermal treatments to facilitate the subsequent recovery of these valuable metals. Sieve analysis showed that direct crushing for 2 min resulted in 40.81 % of the anode material in the 4750 + 2500 μm size range, while 5 min of crushing led to a more even distribution, with 28.57 % in the smallest size range (−75 μm). Heat treatment followed by 2 min of crushing concentrated 52.38 % of the anode material in the 4750 + 2500 μm range. For the cathode material, 2 min of direct crushing distributed 24.49 % in the −2500 + 1250 μm range, while 5 min of crushing accumulated 38.80 % in the −75 μm range. Heat treatment and 2 min of crushing resulted in 56.05 % of the cathode material in the −75 μm range, indicating improved liberation. The combination of heat treatment and mechanical treatment effectively liberates and reduces the size of the active materials, resulting in a higher cumulative mass fraction of finer particles (≤630 μm). Heat treatment at 600 °C for 15 min, followed by 2 min of crushing, dissociated current collectors (Al) from the cathode material, minimized the harmful gas emissions and produced fine particles (630 μm) with minimal Al content (0.8 wt%).

Process intensification is examined for the leaching of valuable and rare earth elements (REEs), such as Ni, Co, La, Nd, and Ce, from spent nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries using subcritical water extraction (SWE) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). Results of SWE revealed that HCl performed better than H2SO4 and HNO3. Leaching efficiency increased as reaction temperature increased from 100 to 150°C, and it increased with HCl concentration.

This study aims to develop a low-temperature pyro-metallurgical combined process to recycle spent LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523). Unlike traditional pyrometallurgy methods that generate liquid alloys and slags at temperatures exceeding 1000 °C, the (NH4)2S2O8 roasting approach operates at 350 °C and converts NCM523 to water-soluble sulfates, exhibiting remarkable leaching efficiencies of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn, with values of 99.43 %, 99.87 %, 98.88 %, and 99.19 %, respectively.

Furthermore, the mechanism of sulfation reaction was identified by combining experiments with thermodynamic calculation. At temperatures above 160 °C, (NH4)2S2O8 decomposes into (NH4)2S2O7, which reacts with NCM. Lithium in a layered structure forms Li2SO4, while transition elements form MnSO4, Li2Co (SO4)2, and NiSO4. At around 350 °C, (NH4)2S2O8 further decomposes into NH4HSO4, releasing SO2 and NH3. SO2 reacts with remaining NCM or unsulfated transition metal oxides, converting them into MnSO4, Li2Co (SO4)2, and NiSO4. Above 800 °C, the metal sulfates decompose into stable oxides.

Bearing the merits of easy operation and large capacity, pyrometallurgy methods are mostly used for the regeneration of waste lead-acid battery (LABs). However, these processes are generally operated at the temperature higher than 1300 °C. To shorten the energy consumption, a novel pyrometallurgy process which consisted of low temperature alkaline and bath smelting was proposed in this work. The reduction of lead and smelting of slag system are the key factors determine the energy consumption. Thermodynamic calculation suggested that the addition of Na2CO3 can make the reduction of PbSO4 spontaneously at the temperature higher than 288 °C (PbSO4 → PbCO3 → PbO → Pb), while direct reduction of PbSO4 necessitated the temperature higher than 1499 °C (PbSO4 → PbO → Pb). To achieve the efficient reduction of PbSO4, the molar ratios of C/PbSO4 and Na2CO3/PbSO4 should be higher than 0.5 and 1.0, respectively. Meanwhile, a new smelting system (i.e., FeO-SiO2-CaO-Na2O) was established in the presence of Na2CO3. Phases with low melting temperatures, such as NaFe2O3, Na2FeSiO4, Na2Ca2Si2O7, Na14Fe6O16 and Na0.5FeO2, were formed. The melting temperature of Fe-Si-Ca-Na system was lowered to 1050 °C at the mass dosage of Na2CO3 at 30%. Recovery of lead under various reduction conditions were systematically evaluated.

The results demonstrated that 33.1%, 31.4%, and 31.4% of the PVDF were removed using dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMAc), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 150, 160, and 180 °C, respectively. Under these conditions, the peel-off efficiencies for DMF, DMAc, and DMSO were 92.9%, 85.3%, and approximately 92.9%, respectively.

But plenty of as-generated biogas slurry (BS) with high P concentration was valuable and difficult to dispose. Here, this work proposed a low-carbon emitting Fe-cycle strategy to recover battery-grade FePO4 from BS. At pH=1.0, the P-leaching rate of Fe-sludge (42.93 ± 1.49 mg g−1) generated by polymerized ferrous sulfate (an inorganic polymer coagulant) addition into BS was 93.46 ± 3.56% and high-purity FePO4 (99.0%) could further be obtained by Fe3+ supplement and pH adjustment (pH=2.0). The contents of all elements in recovered FePO4 product fully complied with the battery grade of national industry standard of China (HG/T 4701-2021). After battery-grade FePO4 precipitate separation, recovery solution (RS) with remaining Fe3+ was reutilized to remove 88.05 ± 1.77% of P when mixed with BS wit RS/BS ratio of 2:1, thus achieving a Fe cycle utilization. Meanwhile, the recovery cost of 5.42 $/kg P and CO2 emissions of 80.83 kg/kg P were lower than those of current FePO4 industrial production (14.60 $/kg P and 110.60 kg/kg P). Finally, the LiFePO4/C cathode material based on recovered FePO4 from BS exhibited stable discharge specific capacity of 84.6–100.2 mAh/g during 100 charge–discharge cycles.

With alkaline leaching, microwave- (1 cycle, 3 min, 4mol/L NaOH) and ultrasound-assisted (14min, 0.1p, 20% amplitude, 4mol/L NaOH) leaching extracted about 80% of the Zn and less than 0.01% of the Mn, which resulted in lesser concentrated Zn solutions (approximately 16.5g/L) but with high purity (>99.5%) that was suitable for the recovery of Zn by precipitation. The microwave- and ultrasound-assisted leaching strategies used in this work proved to be efficient and environmentally-friendly approaches for the extraction of Zn from spent alkaline residues since a concentrated Zn solution with adequate purity for subsequent Zn recovery was obtained using significantly decreased leaching times and concentrations of chemicals.","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)', 'LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2', 'NaHSO4·H2O'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['roasting and water leaching'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['600 °C for 30 min', 'water leaching at 60 °C for 30 min'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['Li', 'Mn', 'Co', 'and Ni']}","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['lithium-ion batteries'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['solvent extraction'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['pH 10', '30 °C', '0.5 M Li2SO4', 'and 0.1 M H2SO4'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['cathode active materials']}

In this paper, we report a new process for selective extraction of lithium from spent lithium-ion power batteries by roasting a mixture of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 and NaHSO4·H2O followed by water leaching. The most suitable conditions included roasting LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2:NaHSO4·H2O at 600 °C for 30 min in a mass ratio of 1:1.40, followed by water leaching at 60 °C for 30 min with a liquid/solid ratio of 25:1 (mL/g).

A novel approach for the preparation of battery-grade FePO4·2H2O from iron phosphate residue by H3PO4 leaching and precipitation without alkali addition was proposed in this study. Under the optimized conditions of H3PO4 concentration of 6 mol L−1, liquid-solid ratio of 7.5 mL g−1, leaching temperature of 75 °C, and leaching time of 180 min, the leaching rates of 99.2% and 98.0% were achieved for Fe and P, respectively. During the leaching process, first dissolved Fe and P will recombine to form FePO4·2H2O, whereas the complete dissolution of FePO4·2H2O requires an increase in leaching temperature. Subsequently, 93.5% of Fe in the leaching solution can be precipitated as FePO4·2H2O at dilution ratio of 3.5, temperature of 90 °C, and crystallization time of 4 h. The mother liquor can be employed as a leaching agent after simple evaporation; thus, the closed-loop hydrometallurgical method avoids wastewater emissions.

The oxidizing roasting has been preliminarily proven to be a feasible method to pre-treat and recycle spent LiFePO4 battery. However, the kinetics and thermal conversion mechanism of spent LiFePO4 battery during oxidizing roasting process remains indefinable and needs to be elucidated. Therefore, the kinetic analysis and thermal conversion mechanism of the spent LiFePO4 battery during the oxidizing roasting process were investigated in this study. The results indicated that the oxidizing roasting process of the electrode materials (LiFePO4 and C) could be divided into four weight loss stages, and the maximum weight loss took place in the third weight loss stage (500–800 °C). The model-free methods (Flynn-Wall-Ozawa and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose models) could well describe the oxidizing roasting process, and the corresponding E α obtained were 257.38 and 255.35 kJ/mol respectively. The model-fitting methods showed that the three-dimension diffusion model was the most suitable kinetic reaction model for the electrode materials oxidizing roasting process. The graphite in the electrode materials could be easily oxidized to CO2 (the major gaseous product). Besides, the LiFePO4 was firstly oxidized and converted into Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and Fe2O3. Then the Li3Fe2(PO4)3 was decomposed into Li3PO4 and P2O5. Finally, P2O5 could react with Fe2O3 to form FePO4. The physical state of oxidizing roasting products changed from powder to molten state from 600 to 800 °C because of the lower melting point temperature of Li3Fe2(PO4)3, and the oxidizing roasting temperature was suggested to be controlled below 800 °C. The final products obtained from the oxidizing roasting process of the spent LiFePO4 battery electrode materials were Li3Fe2(PO4)3, FePO4 and Li3PO4.

In particular, since a large amount of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) will be generated along with the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs), research on recycling carbon-residues from LIB anodes is urgently needed. Herein, the battery powder (BP) was obtained from spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) through physical-pyrolysis and sieving. Chemical composition analysis confirmed that the battery used in this work was composed of NCM cathode with high-nickel content and graphite anode material. The average particle size of the obtained BP was 87 μm. In order to obtain the residue having high concentration of carbon, the metal extraction was applied using an HCl solution. As a result, metals (Li, Ni, Co, Mn, Al, Cu, and Fe) in the final remnant were found to be less than 2%, and carbon was found to have a purity of 97% or more. The obtained BP was tested as both the adsorbent and support for indoor CO2 capture. Various activation treatments were examined to enhance the textural properties of BP. BP-K (K2CO2 impregnated BP) adsorbents were prepared, and their CO2 adsorption performances were evaluated with CO2 adsorption isotherms, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and 0.1 m 3 chamber (CO2 IR analyzer) at low CO2 level (1000–2000 ppm). Through XRD and FT-IR analyses, the adsorption mechanism between K2CO3 and CO2 under moisture-containing indoor air conditions was confirmed to depend on chemisorption in the following reaction pathway: R1–R3(K2CO3(s) + H2O (g) + CO2 (g) ⇋ 2KHCO3(s) (R1), K2CO3(s) + 1·.5H2O(g) ⇋ K2CO3·1·.5H2O(s) (R2), K2CO3·1·.5H2O(s) + CO2(g) ⇋ 2KHCO3(s) + 0·.5H2O(g)(R3)). The adsorption working capacities of the recycled BP-K adsorbents were remained relatively constant during four consecutive cycles.","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['lithium-ion batteries'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['thermal treatment', 'incineration', 'N2 pyrolysis', 'and CO2 pyrolysis'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['optimal temperatures of incineration', 'N2 pyrolysis', 'and CO2 pyrolysis were 550', '500', 'and 450 °C', '<200 °C'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['organics', 'cathode active materials (CAMs)']}","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['pyrolysis and leaching'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['1000–2000 ppm'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['carbon-residues', 'graphite', 'lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)']}

In this study, the effects of incineration, N2 pyrolysis, and CO2 pyrolysis on the removal of organics and liberation of ternary cathode active materials (CAMs) were compared. The results indicated that the organics in the spent ternary cathode sheets comprised a residual electrolyte and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. Moreover, the organics could be removed to promote the liberation of CAMs via incineration, N2 pyrolysis, and CO2 pyrolysis. When the temperature was <200 °C, the chemical properties of the volatilized ester electrolyte remained unchanged during both N2 and CO2 pyrolysis, indicating that the electrolyte can be collected by controlling the pyrolysis temperature and condensation. Furthermore, PVDF binder decomposition occurred at 200–600 °C. The optimal temperatures of incineration, N2 pyrolysis, and CO2 pyrolysis were 550, 500, and 450 °C, respectively, and these treatments increased the liberation efficiency of CAMs from 81.49 % to 98.75 %, 99.26 %, and 97.98 %, respectively. In addition, heat-treated CAMs required less time to achieve adequate liberation. Following three thermal treatment processes, the sizes of the CAM particles were mainly concentrated in the ranges of 0.075–0.1 mm and <0.075 mm. Furthermore, for all types of CAMs examined, the Al concentration decreased from 1.09 % to <0.35 %, which increased the separation efficiency and improved the chemical metallurgical performance.","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['lithium-ion battery (LIB)'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['pyrolysis', 'residue grinding', 'classification (sieving)', 'wet magnetic separation', 'acid leaching', 'hydroxide precipitation', 'and desalination to drying'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['pyrolysis at 800 °C', 'half-cell was 120 mAh/g at 15 mA g−1', 'full-cell using a graphite anode at 0.1 C was 85 mAh/g'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['ternary Li transition metal oxide (LTMO)']}","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['Lithium-ion batteries'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['microwave-assisted acid leaching'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['microwave power of 800 W', 'leaching time of 120 min', 'pulp density of 200 g/L', 'H2SO4 concentration of 1.0 mol/L', 'pH of 2.0', 'solid–liquid ratio of 100 g/L', 'recovery rate of 98.36 %'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['cobalt']}

Herein, we present a feasibility study on the recovery of ternary Li transition metal oxide (LTMO) cathode active materials from the residue of a waste automotive LIB stack using pyrolysis at 800 °C without exposure to air. Sequential processes from pyrolysis, residue grinding, classification (sieving), wet magnetic separation, acid leaching, hydroxide precipitation, and desalination to drying were used to prepare the precursor of the cathode active material. The precursor was mixed with Li2CO3 and sintered in air at 800 °C, which yielded LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM) with metallic impurities of Al, Cu, and Fe at a total of 4 mass% as well as excess Li and residual F. The electrochemical performance of waste LIB-derived LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (W-NCM) cathode active materials was evaluated in half-cell and full-cell configurations and compared with that of a commercial LIB cathode active material of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) used in automobile applications. The Li-ion extraction/insertion specific capacity of W-NCM in the half-cell was 120 mAh/g at 15 mA g−1, which was 70.4 % that of NCM. The specific capacity of W-NCM in a full-cell using a graphite anode at 0.1 C was 85 mAh/g, which was 69.1 % that of NCM. However, W-NCM in the full-cell exhibited much higher capacity retention (91.2 %) after 1000 charge–discharge cycles at 2 C, while the capacity retention of NCM was 34.0 %. The excellent cycling performance of W-NCM was attributed to the co-existence of metallic impurities.

The results of the high-temperature reduction process demonstrated that the reduction process could be divided into five temperature ranges (e.g., <120 °C, 120°C–220 °C, 220°C–380 °C, 380°C–600 °C, and >600 °C), and the reduction reaction mainly occurred in the third and fourth stages, especially in the ranges of 300–330 °C and 410–430 °C. The results of the microwave absorption characteristics under different conditions demonstrated that high temperatures were favorable for microwave penetration, and the microwave penetration depth (Dp) was 4 cm at 900 °C. In addition, when the moso bamboo content exceeded 16%, the εr"" (effective loss factor) and tan δ (loss angle tangent) of the mixtures suddenly dropped to lower levels by approximately 0.064 and 0.087, respectively. It was also found that when the moso bamboo content was 12%, the mixture had better thermal reduction and microwave dielectric properties.","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['NiMH batteries'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['hydrometallurgical process followed by effective precipitation'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['[H3PO4] = 2 mol/L', 'T = 80 °C', 'and S/L = 1: 10 g/mL'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['light rare earth elements (LREEs) oxides']}","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['lithium-manganese batteries'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['microwave heating process'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['high-temperature reduction process', 'effective loss factor', 'loss angle tangent'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['moso bamboo', 'lithium and manganese']}

The operational leaching parameters such as phosphoric acid concentration, temperature, and the solid–liquid ratio were first optimized by Box-Behnken design. The results reveal that under optimum conditions ([H3PO4] = 2 mol/L, T = 80 °C, and S/L = 1: 10 g/mL) the leaching efficiencies of Ni, Co reach 98.1% and 99.3%.

After mechanical separation, dissolution of the electrode material in H2SO4 and iron removal the leach liquor obtained was subjected to solvent extraction for the extraction and separation of all the three metal ions. The conditions were optimized for the selective recovery of Cd using 20% D2EHPA with 60% saponification. Saturated loading capacity for 20% (60% saponified D2EHPA) was found to be 10.89gL−1 Cd, 1.404gL−1 Ni, and 0.032gL−1 Co at O/A ratio of 1:1. McCabe–Thiele plot at varying O/A ratio indicated the requirement of 4 stages for 100% extraction of Cd at O/A ratio of 1:1.5. The dependence of extraction on pH indicated that the extraction of Cd(II) proceeds according to a cation-exchange reaction at lower acidity and to a solvating reaction at higher acidities. The co-extracted Ni and Co were effectively scrubbed with 50gL−1 CdSO4 at pH 0.5. 99.6% Cd was stripped from the loaded D2EHPA with 75gL−1 of H2SO4.

However, the recovery efficiency of the alkaline solution and organic solvent methods currently used to separate Al foil from cathode materials still has room for improvement. The insufficient separation of Al foil and complexity of the battery types present obstacles to the extraction of valuable metals using simple processes. In this study, an efficient approach is developed to separate the Al foil in mixed-type spent LIBs (M-LIBs), namely, LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM), LiFePO4 (LFP), and LiMn2O4 (LMO) LIBs, by controlled pyrolysis. Hundred percent of the Al foil was recovered at the temperature of 450 °C, holding time of 60 min, and heating rate of 10 °C/min. The purity of Al in the recovered foil was 99.41 %, 99.83 % and 99.92 %, and the recovery efficiency of the active cathode materials was 96.01 %, 99.80 % and 99.15 % for NCM, LFP and LMO, respectively, without the loss of active cathode materials. The obtained active cathode materials exhibited a favorable crystalline structure, and the average particle diameter was reduced from 300.497 to 24.316 μm with a smaller and looser morphology. The process could be well fitted with the Friedman differential equation, and the correlation coefficients were higher than 0.99. The efficient separation could be attributed to the complete rupture of long chain –(CH2CF2)–n bonds in the poly (vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) binder, which resulted in the formation of HF, trifluorobenzene, alkanes, and gaseous single molecule CH2 CF2. Therefore, this work potentially provides an alternative approach for the efficient separation of Al foil in M-LIBs, thereby simplifying the process and achieving lower cost, reduced loss of valuable metals, and higher recovery efficiency.","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)', 'xLi2MnO3·(1-x)LiMO2 cathode materials'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['ammonium sulfate roasting method'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['roasting temperature of 450 °C', 'roasting time of 24 min'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['Li', 'Ni', 'and Mn']}","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['lithium-ion power batteries (LIBs)'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['controlled pyrolysis'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['450 °C', '60 min', '10 °C/min'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['Al foil']}

This necessity arises despite the low commercial value of LES, as conventional recovery methods are cost-prohibitive, leading to insufficient attention to LES recovery. The recent surge in retired batteries has resulted in a significant accumulation of LES, posing serious environmental concerns, however, the high content of Fe and P resources in LES presents a potential value. The study begins with a theoretical analysis, concluding that the reduction leaching of LES is a feasible approach. By integrating this with the Fe powder synthesis route for FePO4, it is found that efficient leaching of LES can be achieved using a low concentration of H2SO4, thereby significantly reducing the recovery cost. This method not only efficiently utilize LES but also alleviates environmental pressure. The thermodynamic analysis sheds light on the mechanism of LES leaching and FePO4 synthesis, confirming the feasibility of each reaction. Optimal leaching conditions (1.4 times the stoichiometric amount of H2SO4, 1.5 times the amount of Fe powder, an L/S ratio of 5 mL/g, and a reaction duration of 150 min at 60 °C), under which the leaching rates of Fe and P reached 94.66% and 98.23%, respectively. Additionally, the study introduces a method to remove the main impurity Al in LES, achieving a removal rate of over 99%, reducing its concentration to below 100 ppm. Other impurities, such as Ti, Mn, and Zn, also meet the Chinese Chemical Industry Standard (HG/T 4701-2021). Comparative analyses were conducted between regenerated R-FePO4, commercial C–FePO4, and untreated LES (r-FePO4). LiFePO4 materials derived from these sources were synthesized, followed by an evaluation of their electrochemical performance. The regenerated R-FePO4 matched the quality of commercial FePO4 and significantly outperformed r-FePO4. Additionally, the process proposed in this study yields significant economic benefits, estimating a profit of 719.6 $/t of recycled LES.

Recycling LiCoO2 cathodes is critical for stabilizing the Li and Co economy. In this work, a kinetic investigation of a closed-loop oxalate-based process for recovery and separation of Li and Co from LiCoO2 has been developed. Metal extraction from LiCoO2 is a non-catalytic solid-liquid reaction with both solid and aqueous products. To understand the kinetics and identify the rate-limiting mechanism, a combined shrinking core model (cSCM) was used for LiCoO2 digestions. LiCoO2 in the presence of aqueous oxalic acid (H2C2O4) at the optimum concentration of 0.46 M and 100 °C results in efficient extraction and separation of Li and Co. Diffusion of H2C2O4 into LiCoO2 occurs through a product layer of cobalt oxalate dihydrate (CoC2O4·2H2O) that forms on the surface and this process was identified as rate-limiting. The CoC2O4·2H2O was precipitated in a micro-rod morphology when 0.46 M hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was added along with 0.23 M H2C2O4, and the reaction was carried out at a temperature of 55–75 °C.

The aim is to provide a versatile and industrially feasible alternative for liquid–liquid extraction and precipitation for recycling of spent Li-ion batteries. A chelating resin with aminomethylphosphonic acid functional group (Lewatit® MDS TP 260) was used in a laboratory-scale multicolumn configuration that combined counter-current and cross-current operations. The process was operated at 60 °C with a synthetic leachate with pH 1.8 as the feed. A two-step desorption procedure (1.0 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) followed by 0.4 M potassium oxalate (K2C2O4)) was found to prevent accumulation of strongly bound metals in the resin. 1 M H2SO4 was found sufficient for regeneration. Pure raffinate containing Li, Ni, and Co was successfully separated from impurity metals (Mn, Cu, Al, and Fe). In steady state operation, no loss of ion exchange capacity was observed. The process was optimized experimentally with focus on the effect of fresh feed and eluent flow rates to increase the productivity and improve the recovery rates of the target metals while maintaining a raffinate purity of 100 %. Increasing the amount of leachate processed per switch was found to enhance the recovery of Co, Li and Ni due to the displacement effect. Very high recovery yields (96.97 % for Co, 99.15 % for Ni, and 100 % for Li) were achieved. The laboratory scale unit could process 1.64L(L·h)−1 of leachate to yield 34.04 g(L·h)−1 of Li+Ni+Co mixture in the raffinate. Moreover, Cu+Mn and Al+Fe rich extract streams with 84.74 % and 97.46 % purities were obtained as by-products. With respect to the recovery rates, the continuous ion exchange process is superior to batchwise operation of ion exchange columns, conventional solvent extraction and not to mention precipitation processes making it a viable alternative in hydrometallurgical LIB recycling.","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['Nickel–metal hydride (Ni–MH) batteries'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['leaching mechanism'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['2M H2SO4', '100g/L pulp density and 348K temperature after 120min of leaching'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['nickel', 'cobalt', 'iron', 'manganese and zinc']}","{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['Lithium-ion batteries'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['leaching', 'solvent extraction', 'precipitation', 'washing', 'drying'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['pH 1.8', '2.0', '2.5', '3.0', '3.5', '4.0', '4.5', '5.0', '5.5', '6.0', '6.5', '7.0', '7.5', '8.0', '8.5', '9.0', '9.5', '10.0', '10.5', '11.0', '11.5', '12.0', '12.5', '13.0', '13.5', '14.0', '14.5', '15.0', '15.5', '16.0', '16.5', '17.0', '17.5', '18.0', '18.5', '19.0', '19.5', '20.0', '20.5', '21.0', '21.5', '22.0', '22.5', '23.0', '23.5', '24.0', '24.5', '25.0', '25.5', '26.0', '26.5', '27.0', '27.5', '28.0', '28.5', '29.0', '29.5', '30.0', '30.5', '31.0', '31.5', '32.0', '32.5', '33.0', '33.5', '34.0', '34.5', '35.0', '35.5', '36.0', '36.5', '37.0', '37.5', '38.0', '38.5', '39.0', '",798,FALSE

Based on the concept of complete resource recovery and zero pollution, a novel process for metal recovery from CTWA has been developed. D2EHPA was used to extract Sc, V from CTWA. Al was completely removed by slowly adding 1.5 mol/L NaOH until the solution pH reached 4.20 and stabilized for 0.5 h. This process resulted in a limited loss of 11 % for Fe and 5 % for Mn. An oxidative precipitation method was proposed to process the Al-free solution to preparate a pure and easily filterable FePO4 product, which can be used in the production of battery materials. Additionally, the loss of Mn in this process was less than 0.5 %. After removing Fe and Al, the pre-extraction feed has an O/A ratio of 2.5:1, a temperature of 40 °C, and an equilibrium pH of 4.5 ∼ 5.0, it is possible to extract Mn at over 99.50 % using a 5-stage extraction.

The stripped solution can be 100 % crystallized to obtain battery-grade MnSO4·H2O products after removing heavy metals using BaS and removing oil with activated carbon. The recovery of Mn in the extraction process was 97.59 %. The pilot test was conducted to demonstrate that the extraction process can be efficiently and continuously produced.

Based on the thermal behavior by TG-DSC analysis, the cathode active powder is calcined at 300 °C and 550 °C in air atmosphere, and the crystalline phase characterization indicates that a new phase of Co3O4 appears in the cathode active powder calcined at 550 °C, which signifies that the layer structure of LiCoO2 collapses. The valence of manganese increases to form Li4Mn5O12 in spinel structure of LiMn2O4. Using calcined cathode powder as feed material, ammoniacal leaching is carried out in (NH4)2SO4 -(NH4)2SO3 solution.

In the method-2, the generated Fe2+ originating from LiFePO4 is fully utilized with the addition of H2O2, and the dosage of Fe2(SO4)3 is decreased by two thirds (Fe2(SO4)3 : LiFePO4 =1:6). Several sulphates (CuSO4, NiSO4, MgSO4) are employed to explore the leaching mechanism. All the results reveal that the reaction of Fe3+ substituting Fe2+ has a powerful driving force. In addition, these two leaching processes simultaneously present superior selectivity for the impurities. The Fe2(SO4)3 in two methods does not cause pollution and is easily regenerated by adding H2SO4.

A H2SO4 solution of 1.5 M or higher could completely strip the extracted Cu from the organic phase. The regenerated cathode material LiNi0.5Co0.5O2 appeared as spherical particles with no impurities and demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance.

The GAC prepared at 500 °C achieved highest removal and recovery efficiencies of Co in the 3D-MFC system. The maximum removal efficiency of 98.47%, the recovery efficiency of 96.35%, the power density of 11.34 W/m3, and the columbic efficiency of 28.74% were obtained in the orthogonal experiments. The influence of the operating time on the removal and recovery of Co was more obvious than the electro-output of the system. The addition of ammonium carbonate to the 3D-MFC systems clearly increased the precipitation of Co. The stacking of GAC particles in MFC had strengthened the adsorption of Co ions by intensifying the acidic-alkaline pathways during the 3D BE process. The removal and recovery of Co ions from the stripping solution in the 3D-MFC experiments were mainly achieved by the electromigration, electrostatic adsorption of GAC, and chemical precipitations of cobalt hydroxide and cobalt carbonate.

Here we demonstrate that this precipitation is a phenomenon that depends on both Na+ and SO4 2− concentrations and not solely on pH. A two-stage leaching for industrially crushed NiMH waste is performed: The first stage consists of H2SO4 leaching (2 M H2SO4, L/S = 10.4, V = 104 ml, T = 30 °C) and the second stage of H2O leaching (V = 100 ml, T = 25 °C). Moreover, precipitation experiments are separately performed as a function of added Na2SO4 and H2SO4. During the precipitation, higher than stoichiometric quantities of Na to REE are utilized and this increase in both precipitation reagent concentrations results in an improved double sulfate precipitation efficiency. The best REE precipitation efficiencies (98–99%) – achieved by increasing concentrations of H2SO4 and Na2SO4 by 1.59 M and 0.35 M, respectively – results in a 21.8 times Na (as Na2SO4) and 58.3 times SO4 change in stoichiometric ratio to REE.

Herein, we propose a fast ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) salt roasting method to extract Li and recycle FePO4 from commerical LiFePO4 cathode materials. Compared with the traditional hydrometallurgy recovery process, (NH4)2SO4 assisted roasting achieved the fast delithiation of LiFePO4 within 5 min at 300 °C, and converted LiFePO4 to FePO4 in air atmosphere. Almost 98% of Li was converted to soluble Li2SO4, and air acted as a clean and cheap oxidant. TG-DSC analysis in different atmospheres indicated that the whole reaction mainly consisted of two steps: (NH4)2SO4 firstly decomposed to NH4HSO4 and (NH4)2S2O7, and then the LiFePO4 reacted with O2, (NH4)2SO4 and (NH4)2S2O7 at ∼300 °C.

Upcycling is going to be in growing demand since the first generation NMC 111 cathode chemistries evolve to higher energy/nickel-rich formulations.

To address this problem, herein, low valence vanadium (LVV) solution is produced from vanadium slag under controlled oxidation, additionally, V(IV), Fe(II), Cr(III), and Mn(II) are separated from the LVV solution through sodium diethyldithiocarbamate complexation (DDTC), based on previous studies. Subsequently, V(IV) is recovered as calcium salt of V(IV) (CaV2O5), which is subjected to sodium carbonate leaching and solvent extraction with Aliquat 336 in the form of tetramine to produce a high-purity VOSO4 solution. This solution serves as an electrolyte for the vanadium redox flow battery. During leaching, CaV2O5 is converted to CaCO3 as vanadium is recovered in solution up to 99.2%, wherein 88.2% vanadium is in the form of V(IV), thus indicating that vanadium is slightly oxidized after leaching for 60 min. Analysis of the leaching mechanism reveals that V(IV) is in the form of V4O9 2− and HV2O5 − in the pregnant leach solution (PLS), and V(V) is in the forms of VO4 3−. After acidification with H2SO4, Aliquat 336 extracts V(IV) and V(V) via an anion-exchange mechanism, without adjusting the pH of the leach solution. Further, equations for the extraction and stripping reactions are deduced. The total vanadium extraction and stripping efficiencies exceed 99.3% and 97.2%, respectively. Finally, high-purity VOSO4 electrolyte is obtained after using activated carbon to remove organic, and the corresponding V(IV) ion concentration reaches 77.8 g/L. The cyclic voltammetry test results reveal identical electrochemical properties between the electrolyte product and commercial high-purity VOSO4.

This study employed a glucose-based DES of choline chloride to recover cobalt, manganese, nickel, and lithium from LIB cathode materials, optimizing temperature and time parameters in the range of 60–110 °C and 2–24 h for leaching the cathode materials. The highest metal recoveries were observed between 60 and 110 °C, with 82.4% for Ni, 94.2% for Co, 97.6% for Ni, and 93.7% for Li after 24 h of leaching at 100 °C. The Co, Mn, Ni, and Li recoveries in the DES solution increased with time at 100 °C. UV–visible spectroscopy analysis investigated the leaching mechanisms for cathode metals, confirming that the spent LIBs leaching in DES (ChCl:G) is not completely associated with the reduction of cobalt. It appears that other metal ions, such as Li, Mn, and Ni, form complexes with chloride ions originating from the choline chloride agent. The results of the MD simulation show that hydrogen of the OH in choline chloride has a very strong attractive interaction with the Cl− ion. Also, H atoms of OH groups in glucose molecules interact considerably with the chloride ion of choline chloride. In addition, all H atoms of OH groups in glucose form hydrogen bonds with O5 of the glucose. All metal ions, including Co3+, Li+, Mn2+, and Ni2+, have very strong electrostatic interactions with the Cl− of the choline chloride molecule. The MD calculations show that metal ions are complexed with some oxygen atoms of the glucose molecule. Results show that the choline chloride molecule (via Cl− ion) and glucose molecule (via oxygen atoms) play a significant role in the leaching of metal ions from LIBs via electronegative atoms.

Hydrometallurgical derived full-component separation strategy has been verified as the most capable recycling process for LiFePO4 cathode. During which, complete elements (i.e., Li, Fe and P) are dissolved into a solution of excessive acidic leachate, and subsequently separated to obtain battery-grade FePO4·2H2O and lithium salt, enabling high element recovery rates of up to 100 %. However, the use of excessive leaching agent leads to high acidity of the leaching solution (pH < 0.8), which brings a necessary of pH regulation prior to the regeneration of FePO4·2H2O, markedly complicating the succedent separation and purification. In this investigation, a practical method for directly regenerating FePO4·2H2O from H2SO4-based full-component leaching solution is proposed. In this process, H2SO4 as leaching agent is used to digest LiFePO4 completely, and then Fe and P are premeditatedly recovered from the extremely acidic filtrate (pH < 0.8) as FePO4·2H2O via direct precipitation without any pH regulator. Consequently, there are no extra impurities affecting the recovery of Fe and P during regeneration. The regeneration behavior of FePO4·2H2O under extremely acidic condition are investigated and the growth mechanism is also clarified by monitoring the overall microstructure and phase evolutions. The results demonstrate that the above regeneration is found to be an exponential growth process driven by the quantity of nucleation site, and meanwhile influenced by the dissolution-reprecipitation equilibrium of amorphous iron phosphate. Specifically, the process can be accelerated by introducing FePO4·2H2O or amorphous iron phosphate to increase the nucleation sites. Additionally, the primary nanosheet size of regenerated FePO4·2H2O causes a smaller primary particle size of the corresponding LiFePO4/C material, contributing to its better physical and electrochemical properties.

Black mass originating from alkaline and ZnC batteries was thermally treated under four different atmospheres: O2, N2, H2 and air at different temperatures (300–950 °C). Samples without prior thermal treatment and solid residues after thermal treatment were subsequently leached with H2SO4. Leaching of the samples without the thermal treatment was done to determine the reference leaching conditions, which were established to be 0.5 M H2SO4 at 25 °C for 60 min. Subsequently, samples which had been thermally treated were leached using the aforementioned reference conditions. The effect of thermal treatment on the leaching of Mn and Zn was studied to determine which conditions may improve or hinder subsequent hydrometallurgical processing of alkaline batteries. The use of O2 during the thermal treatment led to formation of ZnMn2O4, which inhibited effective leaching. ZnMn2O4 was decomposed in N2 atmosphere and in the presence of C, improving further dissolution of Mn. The use of H2 led to formation of Mn3O4.

About 50% of initial LIB wastes was recovered by the first treatment (as electrodic powder with size <0.5mm, Sample 1), while only 37% of powder with size <1mm (Sample 2) can be recovered by the second treatment. Chemical digestion put in evidence the heterogeneity of recovered powders denoting different amounts of Co, Mn, and Ni. Leaching tests of both powders were performed in order to determine optimized conditions for metal extraction. Solid/liquid ratios and sulfuric acid concentrations were changed according to factorial designs at constant temperature (80°C).

Among the various candidates of green leaching agents, 2 M citric acid and 5 wt% glucose were selected as the leachant and reductant, respectively. Microwave irradiation was conducted during the leaching step to maximize the performance of the leaching rate and efficiency.

The results indicated that temperature is a more important factor than seed crystal or flocculant. After that, Li3PO4 was dissolved by acid as the anolyte, and electrodialysis with cation-exchange membranes was used to investigate the separation performance of Li and P. The results showed that Li and P was effectively separated by electrodialysis, and the P/Li mass ratio of the catholyte was reduced to 0.23 (6.5 times lower compared to a feed P/Li ratio of 1.48). Deep separation of lithium and phosphorus in the catholyte was achieved by raising pH to make the lithium precipitated with the permeated phosphorus.

Maximum sorption capacity reaches 20 mmol Li g−1, and the sorption isotherms are fitted by the Langmuir Dual Site equation; the process being spontaneous, exothermic and enthalpy-driven. The sorption remains highly efficient in 1 M NaCl solution, while the uptake remains strongly selective in the presence of equimolar concentrations of alkali-earth and heavy elements (Fe > Zn > Mg > Ca > Ni > Al cations). This selectivity (SCLi/Metal varying between 14 and 36) is controlled by the pH (optimum close to 2.2) and slightly increases (up to 16–69) with adding oxalic acid (1% w/w). The equilibrium is achieved, under selected experimental conditions, within 30–90 min of contact (depending on temperature).

Therefore, recycling Co from the spent Co-enriched materials is indispensable. Co-based perovskites, which contain abundant Co, are extensively utilized in solid oxide fuel cells, three-way catalysts, and oxygen-permeable membranes, and the recovery of Co from the spent Co-based perovskites is necessary to meet the long-term requirement of Co. In this work, a facile and universal thermal reduction method (750 °C and N2 atmosphere) is employed to convert the spent cobalt-based perovskites into high-performance bifunctional oxygen catalysts for zinc-air batteries (ZABs), achieving high-efficient Co recovery and re-utilization. At high temperatures, melamine and dopamine hydrochloride are transformed into carbon nanotubes, C3N4 and reducing gases (such as NH3 and H2). Simultaneously, the metal elements in the spent Co-based perovskites (SrNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3,SNCF) are converted into nano-scale alloy particles and metal nitrides. Then, the phase structures, micromorphology, and element valences of the obtained multiphase oxygen catalyst (SNCF–Ni-PM) are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning/transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. The electrochemical properties, including oxygen catalytic activities and stability, of SNCF-Ni-PM are measured by linear sweep voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, chronoamperometry, and cyclic voltammetry methods. Considering the practical applications, the aqueous and solid-state ZABs are assembled and measured.

The cathodic part of LIBs, which are mainly composed of Li, Al and Co, sourced from electronic waste (e-waste) was first subjected to a suspension stage for removing Al. XRD analysis of the cathodic sample free of Al (C1) revealed that C1 was in the form of LiCoO2. Thermal behavior of C1 was also examined against time and temperature using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Thermal isolation of C1 was carried out via reduction in argon atmosphere using activated carbon at temperature in the range of 600 °C to 800 °C for 30 min. At 600 °C, no dissociation of the initial compound of LiCoO2 was observed. At 800 °C Li totally liberated from the sample in form of gas and cobalt oxide was reduced to the metallic cobalt. However, at 700 °C, Li was thermally isolated in form of solid lithium carbonate and separated from Co. Temperature of 700 °C was selected as the optimum temperature for thermal isolation of Li which resulted in dissociation of LiCoO2 into Co, CoO and Li2CO3. After thermal isolation at 700 °C, the resulting mixture (C2) was dispersed into distilled water, placed in a cold-water bath with temperature of 0 °C and was allowed to gradually dissolve in water for 1 h. After filtration and washing using a centrifuge, the solution was subjected to ICP analysis and the undissolved particles were dried in an oven overnight prior to further reduction at 700 °C for full reduction of cobalt oxide to metallic cobalt.

Selective adsorption presents a promising technology for metal recycling from wastewater; however, there is currently no adsorbent that exhibits sufficient selectivity for Ni2+ over other divalent metals. In this study, we synthesized highly Ni2+ selective alginate beads modified with dimethylglyoxime (D-Ca-alg) and evaluated their Ni2+ separation and enrichment behavior. D-Ca-alg exhibited superior Ni2+ adsorption capacity (74.9 mg/g) compared to pristine alginate beads (Ca-alg) (50.6 mg/g). By increasing the solution pH, the Ni2+ uptake of D-Ca-alg proportionally increased and reached a maximum (61.6 mg/g at pH > 5).

At low temperature (≤460 °C), copperas reacted with lithium on the outer layer of LIBs preferentially, but the reduction of transition metals was limited. As the temperature rose to 460–700 °C, the extraction efficiency of valuable metals was greatly enhanced due to the generation of SO2, and the gas–solid reaction proceeded much fast than the solid–solid reaction.

Batch experiments were carried out under varying pH (3–11), temperature (15–50 °C), and agitation speed (50–200 rpm) to understand their effects on removal efficiency. The CAB-MOACs had better removal efficiency for p-cresol and tylosin than alginate beads alone or beads containing only AC or MnO2.

This need will only be exasperated in the future as personal electronic equipment and electric vehicles (EV) become more widespread. In this study, a simple process for the separation of the cathode materials from waste Apple iPhone 6 lithium batteries is proposed, consisting of thermal treatment followed by ultrasonication. The main advantages of the process are its simplicity and complete independence from all chemicals. Heating the cathode material to 550°C gradually increases the removal efficiency; however, further increase in temperature results in a sharp decline of removal due to changes in the Al foil structure. With limited aeration inside the muffle furnace the removal barely exceeded 60%, whereas under suitable aeration, removal efficiencies exceeding 90% were obtained. Ultrasonication aids the release of cathode powder by creating convective flow as well as intense cavitation. As ultrasonication time and power increase, so does the removal efficiency. However, by increasing the power from 50 W to 100 W, the cathode powder separation efficiency decreases. This is because the numerous cavitation bubbles create a barrier for the transmission of acoustic energy to other parts of the tank, meaning the physical vibration of the transducer is greater than the fluid's ability to stay in contact. The final obtained cathodic powder under optimum conditions (heating for 15 min at 550°C, followed by ultrasonic treatment at 45°C and 50 Watts for 1 min) was 45.5% Co, 4.9% Al, 13.7% Cu, 3.6% Li, and 13.7% Ni.",,"{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['Lithium-ion batteries (LIB)'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['Thermal treatment followed by ultrasonication'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['550°C', '15 min', '45°C', '50 Watts'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['cathodic powder']}

However, efficient removal of impurities is a common challenge for hydrometallurgical process. A facile recovery route of spent lead-acid battery pastes, including efficient desulfurization and pH-controlled acid leaching, is proposed. Effects of two typical desulfurizers (NaOH and Na2CO3) on desulfurization efficiency and removals of major impurities (Ba and Fe elements) were comparatively investigated for the first time. NaOH was more effective than Na2CO3 with a higher desulfurization efficiency of 99.3 wt% in 10 min. Approximately 26.2 wt% of BaSO4 in the raw spent lead paste was converted into BaCO3 in the Na2CO3 desulfurization system, causing more Ba element entered into the acid leaching solution. The significant decrease of pH in the acid leaching solution caused a high concentration of Fe element impurity, which was efficiently removed by further pH adjustment. The optimal conditions were determined to be: a NaOH/PbSO4 molar ratio of 2.0 in the desulfurization step, a HNO3/Pb molar ratio of 2.2 in the acid leaching step, and followed by adjusting the pH of the acid leaching solution to about 3.48. Up to 98.4 wt% of the Pb was recovered, while 99.8 wt% of Ba and 99.9 wt% of Fe element impurities were removed.

Presently, we reclaimed Mn from the spent Li-ion battery cathode materials for hydrothermally synthesizing MnO2/Fe(0) composites, which were used as the efficient heterogeneous photo-Fenton catalyst. The new composite was well characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence (PL) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) methods before optimizing their usage for sulfadiazine destruction. The catalytic efficiency of the MnO2 substrate was enhanced by impregnating different proportions of Fe(0) into the substrate. The MnO2: Fe(0) molar ratio at 40:1 (MnO2-40Fe) shows optimal catalytic activity. Sulfadiazine degradation by 0.2 g/L MnO2-40Fe, 6 mM H2O2 in pH 3 is almost 98.6%, and it follows first-order kinetics. The MnO2 and nano zero-valent iron synthesized using spent cathode of Li-ion batteries is equally efficient in sulfadiazine even after five times repeated use.

The excellent degradation performance of the as-prepared catalyst might be attributed to the introduction of nano zero-valent iron on the nanostructured MnO2, which not only provides more active sites, but also has a synergistic effect with MnO2 and light irradiation, leading to the generation of large amounts of activated radicals for destructing sulfadiazine.

Traditional smelting methods, however, face criticism for their substantial energy requirements and the loss of lithium in slag. In this study, an innovative laser-based in-situ pyrometallurgical process, hereinafter referred to as laser recycling, was developed to recycle Li-ion batterie materials without using slag, enabling the simultaneous recovery of Co, Ni, Mn, and Li. Lab-scale experiments were carried out to investigate the influences of laser power density and duration on the carbothermic reduction behavior of battery materials. The results showed that the maximum temperature reached approximately 1850 °C with a laser power between 1500 and 2000 W focused to an area of 20 mm in diameter within a few seconds. The laser recycling facilitates concurrent smelting and solid-state reduction, with carbothermic reduction completed in just 30 s due to rapid reaction kinetics, ultra-high temperatures, and the enhanced contact area resulting from surface tension-driven molten material flow under intense laser beam exposure. This laser recycling process reduced LiCoO2 and LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 to metallic Co or Co-Ni-Mn alloy, respectively, while Li was recovered as Li2CO3.

The influence of experimental parameters on Li and Fe leaching efficiencies (η Li, η Fe) were studied by orthogonal and single-factor tests, and η Li ≥ 92.2% while η Fe ≤ 1.6% were obtained under the optimal conditions (6 h, 20 g/L, 8EG:1CC, 40 °C). The impurity Fe in the filtrate was completely precipitated as amorphous FePO4·3H2O after heating (150 °C, 0.5 h), achieving a pure Li-solution. The leaching mechanism elucidated that the synergistic effect (acidification, replacement and oxidation reaction) between the DES and O3 determined the phase transition of Li and Fe, promoting the efficient selective extraction of Li and in-situ separation of Fe (FePO4). The average η Li and η Fe were separately 85.4% and 2.0% after ten cycles of the 8EG:1CC, indicative of its’ excellent reusability. Meanwhile, LiCl was recovered from the filtrate.

Firstly, a molten cryolite-based electrolyte is used to decompose the microstructure of spent LIB cathode material, releasing valuable lithium element into the electrolyte, which can be used in aluminum electrolysis industry. As nickel-cobalt-manganese oxides have low solubilities in the cryolite-based electrolyte, they sink to the bottom of the molten electrolyte, which is then cooled down, forming an upper and lower layer. Lithium element can be quickly and conveniently separated from nickel-cobalt-manganese oxides, which are enriched in the lower layer of the electrolyte. Then, a hydrochloric acid solution is used to leach nickel-cobalt-manganese components from the lower layer of the cryolite-based electrolyte.

The results showed that increasing sulfur concentration improves lithium recovery; while it has no effect on cobalt and nickel dissolution. On the other hand, FeSO4.7H2O increased cobalt recovery and its leaching kinetic significantly. Fe2+ increased cobalt recovery by acting as reducing agent. Just within 2 days of bioleaching with 24.25 g/l FeSO4.7H2O, the Co, Ni and Li recoveries reached 99.9%, 99.7% and 84%.

Conventional battery recycling processes including pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes mainly aim at extracting valuable metallic components from spent LIB cathodes, which requires high temperature reduction and/or acid/alkali chemicals to destroy covalent bond in cathodes and convert them into atoms for further extraction. The former leads to high energy consumption and the latter produces a lot of wastewater, which not only increases cost, but also damages our environment. Moreover, traditional recycling starts from spent battery cathodes and ends up with lithium/cobalt salts, which is unsustainable. Herein, a different recycling strategy to directly convert degraded LiCoO2 into high-voltage LiCoO2 cathode materials was proposed, featuring a closed-loop and green procedure.

A large amount of retired graphite has been produced as the main electrode material, accompanied by a detailed exploration of the repair mechanism. However, they still suffer from unclear repair mechanisms and physicochemical evolution. In this study, spent graphite was repaired employing three methodologies: pickling-sintering, pyrogenic-recovery, and high-temperature sintering. Owing to the catalytic effect of the metal-based impurities and temperature control, the as-obtained samples displayed an ordered transformation, including the interlayer distance, crystalline degree, and grain size. As anodes of lithium ions batteries, the capacity of repaired samples reached up to 310 mA h g−1 above after 300 loops at 1.0 C, similar to that of commercial graphite. Meanwhile, benefitting from the effective assembly of carbon atoms in internal structure of graphite at >1400 °C, their initial coulombic efficiency were >87%. Even at 2.0 C, the capacity of samples remained approximately 244 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles. Detailed electrochemical and kinetic analyses revealed that a low temperature enhanced the isotropy, thereby enhancing the rate properties. Further, economic and environmental analyses revealed that the revenue obtained through suitable pyrogenic-recovering manners was approximately the largest value (5500 $ t−1). Thus, this study is expected to clarify the in-depth effect of different repair methods on the traits of graphite, while offering all-round evaluations of repaired graphite.",,"{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['Lithium-ion batteries'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['pyrogenic-recovery'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['1.0 C', '2.0 C', '300 loops', '500 cycles'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['spent graphite']}

Flotation has been able to separate triplet materials from graphite to some extent, but there are still many problems to be solved in the separation of LiFePO4 from graphite. In this study, a novel flotation reagent regime was proposed to enhance the flotation separation performance of LiFePO4 and graphite electrode materials by carbonaceous surface selective inhibition, which were achieved by H acid as a depressor. The flotation results showed that under the flotation conditions of pH value 9.3 ± 0.1, 10.0 mg/L n-dodecane, 7.5 mg/L MIBC, and 250 mg/L H acid, the recovery of LiFePO4 and graphite were 11.95 % and 94.28 %, respectively. The adsorption kinetic model showed that the adsorption speed of LiFePO4 electrode material is higher than graphite, the adsorption isothermal model showed that the adsorption capacity of LiFePO4 electrode material is significantly higher than graphite. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the interaction between H acid and LiFePO4 or graphite electrode material is mainly π-π interaction. Raman spectroscopy analysis showed that the carbon disorder degree and skeleton form of the graphite and LiFePO4 are significantly different, which makes H acid more easily adsorbed on the surface of LiFePO4.

Transition metal oxides present in the cathode materials were reduced into metallic states. The addition of LCO with a higher activity than LNCMO could reduce the activation energy of cellulose pyrolysis from 141 kJ/mol to 112 kJ/mol as the distributed activation energy model (DAEM) method used. In addition, both LCO and LNCMO showed excellent catalytic performance in converting anhydrosugars to hydrocarbons (e.g., long-chain alkanes). In the addition of LNCMO, the content of anhydrosugars reduced from 35% to 8%, whereas the content of hydrocarbons increased from 2% to 52%.

Nevertheless, among various types of discarded lithium battery electrode materials, limited research has been conducted on the recycling of ternary electrode materials (LiNi x Co y Mn1-x-y O2). This study proposes an eco-friendly process for the efficient recovery of valuable metals and carbon from mixed materials of discarded ternary lithium-ion battery electrodes. This study investigated the influence of various roasting using ammonium sulfate and leaching conditions on the conversion and extraction rates of valuable metals. Under the condition of a 3:1 mass ratio of ammonium sulfate to lithium battery electrode mixed material, roasting temperature of 450 °C, roasting time of 30 min, liquid-solid ratio of 20:1, leaching time of 20 min, and leaching temperature of 60 °C, the recovery rates of various valuable metals including Li, Ni, Co, and Mn reached 99.99%. For the above process, the chemical control reaction prevailed in the initial 10 min of the roasting reaction, succeeded by the dominance of diffusion control reaction in the subsequent 20 min. In the leaching process, the chemical control reaction governed the first 2 min, succeeded by diffusion control reaction for the next 18 min. Analysis of the reaction's macroscopic and microscopic mechanisms reveals that ammonium sulfate roasting of waste ternary lithium-ion batteries constitutes a typical liquid-solid reaction. In the molten state, NH4 + decomposition releases high-energy H+ ions that break the bonds between metals and oxygen. Consequently, metal atoms from the waste battery's crystal structure combine with ammonium sulfate's sulfate groups, forming various metal sulfates.

The influencing factors of reduction temperature, time and H2 flows on reduction characteristics of LiCoO2 carriers were investigated on a laboratory-scale fixed bed.

In this study, a novel approach for recycling valuable metals from spent LiCoO2 batteries via co-pyrolysis with three different carbonaceous materials (waste polyethylene, biomass, and coal)) was proposed and evaluated.

The char produced from the carbonaceous materials, rather than the volatiles, played an important role in LiCoO2 decomposition and reduction. The pyrolysis products of LiCoO2 and coal mixture exhibited typical superparamagnetism and hysteresis behaviours, which benefitted the subsequent magnetic separation.

However, the existing self-powered water treatment technology for metal-air batteries has several challenges. This study proposed a new self-powered water treatment system concept by developing self-filtering aluminum-air (SF Al-air) batteries. The sandwich-shaped flexible air cell comprised an aluminum (Al) scrap anode, an inexpensive hydrophilic separator, and a graphite-coated titanium mesh cathode. By utilizing the capillary action and porous structure of the separator, the autonomous flow and filtration of electrolytes or wastewater were achieved inside the battery. Owing to the high Al purity of 95 % and the ultra-thin structure, the low-cost kitchen Al foil is a promising anode, with the highest power density of 23.02 mW g−1 (anode weight), 4.60 × 10−2 W $−1 (anode cost). Kitchen paper is the preferred separator facilitating electrolyte transfer and automatic renewal inside the battery owing to the strong water storage property. The SF Al-air cell can also efficiently removed 90% of phosphorus at an initial concentration of 100 mg P/L and initial pH = 7. Specifically, the cell converted phosphate pollutants and Al foil waste into a valuable AlPO4·2H2O flame retardant coating on kitchen paper, resulting in a first-class flame retardancy of the separators.

Numerous questions are arising regarding the criticality risks of this key metal of the energy transition. In order to assess the availability of cobalt until 2050, we rely on our linear programming world energy-transport model, TIAM-IFPEN.

However, the mechanism of enhanced lithium extraction has not been fully revealed. This study attempts to uncover the synergistic strengthening mechanisms of mechanical activation-microwave reduction from the aspects of material structure, dielectric properties, reduction kinetics and lithium recovery rate. Mechanical activation induces amorphization and structural defects. The enhanced dielectric properties of materials and the induced hotspots/arc plasmas are also responsible for the enhancement of the reduction reaction. The average dissociation activation energy in the activated sample is 18.0 kJ·mol−1, which is 20.3 kJ·mol−1 lower than that of unactivated sample. The model-free method reveals that the carbothermic reduction process can be divided into three stages: (I) initial stage (α < 0.4(0.6)): the activation energy gradually decreases with the formation of strong microwave acceptor-reduction products; (II) transitional stage (0.4(0.6) < α < 0.7): the increase in mass transfer resistance leads to gradual increase in activation energy. Mechanical activation shortens the transitional reaction stage; (III) later reaction stage (α > 0.7), the decrease in activation energy may be attributed to the enhanced microwave absorption and CO reduction. The model-fitting method reveals that after mechanical activation, the reaction kinetic changes from reaction-order model to Ginstling-Brounshtein diffusion model.

The synthesis of carbon nanomaterials from conversion of waste polymers is an alternative, promising approach owing to the high added-value of these products. In particular, novel carbon materials, could translate into interesting and cheap material for the catalytic reduction of oxygen (ORR), a fundamental reaction for the production of H2O2 or in fuel cell and metal air batteries.

Such a surge in the LIB market and industry has resulted in a huge demand for mineral resources. Besides, the large scale of production will lead to massive amounts of waste batteries in the end. As such, recycling is seen as an end-of-pipe process to resolve sustainability and environmental concerns. The hydrometallurgical recycling is considered to be the most prominent method to recover cathode materials from spent LIBs owing to its high leaching efficiency and low energy costs. A series of procedures including pretreatment of the spent LIBs, acid leaching of the black mass, chemical co-precipitation of the hydroxide precursor, and sintering of the cathode active material need to be operated precisely. In this aspect, the impurities introduced during the process could pose a serious threat to the reaction stability as well as recycling consistency. Here, the impact of sulfide ions on recovered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cathode material with the method of hydrometallurgy is first investigated in detail.

Co-precipitative regeneration of spent LIBs is typically employed to recycle Li, Co, Ni, and Mn. However, it is difficult to evenly distribute metals in the regenerated materials. Moreover, the emission of heavy-metal ions makes it difficult to meet the environmental guidelines. Here, we develop a nucleation–oxidation coupled technology to efficiently recover Ni, Co, and Mn from spent ternary cathodes by forming layered double hydroxides (LDHs) in a micro-liquid-film reactor. After recycling, 98% Li remains in the liquid phase, while the Ni, Co, and Mn in the filtrate decrease to the ppb level. Atomic distribution of Ni, Co, and Mn can be achieved in LDH, which helps realize the full-life-cycle of ternary cathode materials.

In chemical leaching, mathematical models predicting leaching efficiency from liquid-to-solid ratio (L/S; L/kg), temperature (°C), and duration (h) were established and validated. Results revealed that LA of 6.86 M was able to achieve complete leaching of all target metals in the absence of reductants at the optimal conditions (10 L/kg, 90 °C, and 48 h) identified by the models. The evaluation of direct one- and two-step and indirect bioleaching indicated that the latter was more feasible for metal extraction from waste NCM523. L/S was found to impact the indirect bioleaching most significantly among the three operating variables. Pretreatment of waste NCM523 by washing with 1 vol% methanesulfonic acid significantly improved indirect bioleaching.

Furthermore, two kinds of high-efficiency microgenerators were designed. The experimental results showed that under forced convection cooling of a 12 V fan, the cooling capacity of the LHPB with wicks relay was 288 W with a junction temperature maintained below 85 °C.

Furthermore, the unit operation optimization and the extraction mechanism were systematically investigated. Experimental results demonstrated that almost all the Ni and Co were selectively extracted and left the impurities such as Ca and Mg in the raffinate by the synergistic extraction under optimal conditions. Moreover, a quantitative extraction of Mn could be achieved by controlling the excess coefficient of the organic extractant.

The major aim of this study was to develop a novel, low-cost biochemical treatment technology for the management of effluents generated during sulfuric acid–based hydrometallurgical recycling of spent alkaline batteries. We explored the use of various chemical reagents (40% NaOH, 20% Na2CO3, and 1% NH3(aq)) and biogenic ammonia produced by urea-degrading bacteria to increase the pH of the effluents (from pH 0.5 to pH 5.0) and prepare them for further treatment by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Comparisons of the pretreatment efficiency and metal and sulfate removal yields, as well as the characterization of the neutralization products (sediments and effluents) showed that the most promising results were obtained when the raw leachates were treated with 40% NaOH (to reach pH 3.5), followed by the addition of biogenic ammonia (to reach pH 5.0). Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) activity led to a further pH increase (up to ~7.3), almost complete (99%) sulfate removal and metal sulfide (ZnS, MnS) precipitation, as up to ~99% of Zn and Mn were removed in SRB cultures to which appropriately diluted pretreated leachates had been added.

The results showed that the stripping rate of cathode scrap could reach more than 92%, and the recycling did not give rise to any impact on the structure of the cathode material under optimized condition. The molar ratios of elements were signed as n (Li): n (Fe): n (P) = 5 : 4.6: 4.95 by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS).

Air oxidation leaching at room temperature can achieve the efficient recovery of lithium from LFP scrap (generated in LiFePO4 material production), but this method is unsuitable for the treatment of cathode materials from spent LFP batteries. In this work, cyclic voltammetry measurements were first innovatively employed to clarify the reasons for the ineffective leaching of lithium from spent LFP materials via air oxidation leaching and provide the theoretical basis for intensified leaching. Subsequently, a novel method of self-catalytic air pressure leaching was proposed to selectively recover lithium from spent LFP batteries, which ingeniously employs green and cost-free air as the oxidant and self-owned Fe in the LiFePO4 as the O2 deliverer and catalyst. 98.9% Li and only 0.41% Fe, and 3.01% P were leached from spent LFP materials under 0.4 MPa of air pressure, n (H2SO4)/n (Li) ratio of 0.5, liquid to solid ratio of 20 mL/g, 90 °C, and 5 h. The leaching kinetic study was performed and it indicated that the leaching kinetics of Li was controlled by chemical reaction. By combining the results of the thermodynamic analysis and various characterization methods, the reaction course of this self-catalytic air pressure leaching was clarified.

As demand for sustainable building practices grows, interest in recovering gypsum waste from construction and demolition debris is increasing, but there is a lack of standardized tests to evaluate the technical and environmental viability of this solid waste recycling process. By recycling gypsum waste, natural deposits of gypsum might be conserved and high amounts of the waste by-product could be reused in the civil construction industry.

Initially, REEs (La, Ce, Nd, Pr, Dy, and Sm) were thermally isolated from Ni- and Fe-based metallic alloys, while still containing impurities. The impurities were subsequently removed via an oxalate chemical separation. Thermodynamics of REE oxalate formation indicated that the precipitation of pure REE oxalates occurs only at pH≈0.0. As the pH increases, impurities such as Ni are introduced into the REO products. The abundance of C2O4 2- decreases the selective separation, whereas HC2O4 - recovers REEs from the leachate at pH≈0.0. The proposed pH range, as indicated by the speciation plots, not only restricts the trace of contamination but also maximizes the efficiency of the process.

Lithium present in ternary materials can be almost completely transformed into soluble Li2CO3, while the associated Ni, Co and Mn are all converted into insoluble metal elements or their corresponding oxides at 650 °C (t = 90 min). The presence of Al decreases the carbothermal roasting temperature, while the presence of waste carbon allows Li to be converted into easily soluble lithium carbonate in preference to lithium aluminate.

However, the pressure on the supply of critical metals increases with the growth of photovoltaics. Considering the resource availability, the recycling of critical metals from waste solar panels can enhance the sustainability of end-of-life management, although the recycled metal input is limited in present state.

This study investigate a methodology to liberate thin film materials from copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) thin-film solar panel to recycle photovoltaic material including indium and gallium via a mechanical process. An experimental technique using mineral processing techniques, crushing and grinding, are proposed to recycle critical metals from CIGS solar panel.

However, traditional methods have the shortcomings of incomplete separation, release of toxic substances and high cost. Here, the methanol-citric acid solvent (MeOH-CA), prepared from green and low-cost reagents methanol (MeOH) and citric acid (CA), can separate above 99.5 wt% of spent nickel-manganese-cobalt (NCM) cathode materials in 15 min with negligible metal loss at an ultralow temperature of 45 °C. The separated NCM has high purity and no structure changes, and the recovered Al foil is intact and non-corrosive. The mechanism analysis indicates that the reaction between MeOH-CA and Al foil and the inactivation of PVDF by the abundant hydrogen bonds in the MeOH-CA solvent cause the separation. Meanwhile, the formation of AlF3 passivation layer and the ester film on the surface of Al foil prevent further corrosion of Al foil. Through hydrothermal treatment combined with a short thermal annealing, the regenerated NCM delivers a reversible capacity of 151 mAh g−1 at 1C and 117 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles.

Subsequently, separate leaching processes were conducted using sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid solutions, and the results were compared in terms of efficiency and feasibility. Sodium REEs sulfate hydrate (NaRE(SO4)2.xH2O) was precipitated from the sulfuric acid leachate by adjusting the pH to 1.5 using sodium hydroxide, while the addition of oxalic acid to the hydrochloric acid leachate enabled the recovery of REEs as oxalate hydrate (RE2(C2O4)3.xH2O). The resulting sulfate salt was mixed with a sodium hydroxide solution, leading to the formation of REEs hydroxide. The REEs hydroxide and oxalate were calcined at 1000 °C, resulting in the production of REOs with a purity exceeding 99.7%.

Herein, we proposed a novel deep eutectic solvent (DES) leaching method to recover and regenerate waste graphite from spent LIBs under mild condition. The result showed that DES leaching could not only effectively remove the impurities in spent graphite, but also restore its crystal structure and morphology. The regenerated graphite obtained by DES treatment (DRG) exhibited a high specific capacity of 449.4 mAh/g for the first cycle at 0.1C and 285.4 mA h/g even after 500 cycles at 1C.

The development of this study has relied on the prediction of the chemical behavior of the constituting phases based on data obtained from theoretical and experimental equilibrium values. The assessment of the effects of factors on leaching efficiency was also done. It was concluded that about 70% of zinc, as ZnO, can be selectively extracted using this media, under optimized conditions such as 4–5M NH4Cl, 90–100°C and 4h, the remaining zinc namely that corresponding to the spinel form ZnO·Mn2O3 being insoluble.

Stability of chitosan in acidic medium was improved by grafting it with a suitable grafting agent and crosslinking. Further, it was used for the synthesis of acrylamide grafted chitosan based Cd ion imprinted polymer (CdIIP) using Cd as template and epichlorohydrin (EPI) as crosslinker for the selective recovery of Cd. Density functional theory (DFT) confirmed acrylamide as the best grafting agent with ΔG of −17.98 Kcal/mol for the acrylamide grafted chitosan.

This work describes a unique and environmentally acceptable bioleaching method for Li and Mn recovery utilizing Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, a sulfur-oxidizing bacteria that may produce sulfuric acid biologically. The novel feature of this strategy is the step-by-step addition of biogenic sulfuric acid, which differs significantly from conventional methods that use chemical reagents. We expected that gradually introducing biogenic sulfuric acid produced by A. thiooxidans would improve metal leaching at high pulp density. To investigate this, LIBs were disassembled and bioleached with or without a step-wise addition of the biogenic sulfuric acid approach. The impact on leaching efficiency, time, and ultimate product quality was assessed. Direct bioleaching yielded modest Li (43 %) and Mn (15 %) recoveries. However, bioleaching greatly increased metal recovery with the step-wise addition of biogenic acid. Li and Mn leaching efficiency were 93 % and 53 %, respectively, at a high pulp density of 60 g/L, while leaching time was reduced from 16 to 8 days. Following bioleaching, Mn(OH)2 and Li2CO3 were successfully precipitated from the leachate at more than 90 % purity.

To improve the Li recovery, high-pressure acid leaching using H2SO4 for Li preferential liberation and the subsequent purification were systematically investigated. Experimental results showed that 97.6% of Li was preferentially leached with about 2% of Ni, Co, and Mn co-leached, and a leaching solution with a Li+ concentration of 21.46 g/L was obtained.

This study explores a reactor for pyrometallurgical recycling, that offers the potential to overcome this bottleneck by simultaneously recovering lithium and phosphorous (P) via the gas stream, more noble elements including cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu) as an alloy and less noble elements like aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca) and silicium (Si) as a slag. However, to enhance the efficiency and performance of this reactor, a critical focus is placed on evaluating refractory materials with reduced corrosion and diffusion characteristics. Already explored refractory materials, including aluminum oxide (Al2O3) or magnesium oxide (MgO), have exhibited severe issues, such as accelerated corrosion and diffusion rates, leading to diminished performance and compromised efficiency. To evaluate a more suitable refractory material for pyrometallurgical recycling of LIB, tests using silicon carbide (SiC), chromium(III)-oxide (Cr2O3) and zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) were performed up to 1600 °C. The test results indicate that the investigated refractory materials offer distinct advantages and disadvantages. While SiC shows minimal to no wear by corrosion, Cr2O3 exhibits higher resistance to Li diffusion. Contrary, ZrO2 experienced severe corrosion and crack formation, showing unsuitability for LIB recycling. Based on these findings, a continuously operated reactor could use different refractory materials in specific zones. While the degasification zone could benefit from Cr2O3's minimal diffusion properties, areas with intense contact between the crucible and melt could utilize SiC's corrosion resistance.

Compared to similar MnO2 prepared from pure materials, T-MnO2 exhibited superior degradation performance for toluene and chlorobenzene, with T90 decreasing by around 30 °C. The acidic synthesis environment provided by the leaching solution and the doping of trace metals altered the physicochemical properties of T-MnO2, such as increased specific surface area, elevated surface manganese valence, and improved redox performance and oxygen vacancy properties, enhancing its catalytic oxidation capacity. Furthermore, the degradation pathway of toluene on T-γ-MnO2 was inferred using thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS) and in-situ DRIFTs.

By optimizing leaching parameters including temperature, pH, milling time and solid-to-liquid ratio, high leaching efficiencies of 97.1%, 94.0%, 87.6% and 93.8% can be achieved for Li, Ni, Co and Mn respectively. In the mechanochemical process, the breakage of covalent bonds in cathode material is facilitated by free radicals generated from zero valent iron activated ammonia persulfate as well as mechanochemical activation. To further explore the role of free radicals, the mechanism of ammonia persulfate activation by zero valent iron was elucidated, and SO4 •- was identified as the dominant reactive oxygen species in the mechanochemical process. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect of mechanochemically driven crystal dissolution and sulfate radical facilitated bond cleavage was revealed by ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. Moreover, the released metal was reduced by sucrose to a lower valent state of high solubility to promote transfer to the aqueous phase during the subsequent leaching process with dilute sulfuric acid.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with image analysis via density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is presented as a novel method to quantitatively determine the degree of selectivity in a process that applies selective flocculation as a conditioning stage for froth flotation. SEM was shown to provide visual proof of flocculated particles, even in dried froth samples. Under optimal flocculant concentration of 10 g/t only a few flocs were detected in the froth concentrate, suggesting that heteroflocculation of LCO and graphite was minimized under said conditions. Using a flocculant concentration in excess (50 g/t) resulted in multiple flocculated LCO particles within the froth, indicating loss of flocculation selectivity. These results were corroborated by batch flotation experiments, which showed that treating the pulp with 10 g/t flocculant concentration yielded a graphite froth product at a grade of 98.2 %, compared to 98.1 % recovered from a non-flocculated pulp. An excess flocculant concentration led to a drastic reduction in graphite grade. Similar graphite recoveries were observed in all flotation experiments, indicating that the reduced graphite grade with excess flocculant was a result of hydrophobic heteroflocs carrying entrapped LCO to the froth. Proper pH control throughout the experiment prevented a negative influence of flocculation on the kinetics of graphite recovery, which had been reported in earlier research. The results suggest that selective flocculation is a potential method for improving the separation efficiency of graphite from Li-ion battery waste, and that SEM/DBSCAN can be applied for characterization of selectivity in combined flocculation-flotation processes.",,"{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['lithium-ion batteries'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['leaching', 'solvent extraction', 'crystallization'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['pH 1.0', 'oxalic acid 1.0 mol/L', 'NH4Cl 1.0 mol/L', '25 °C', 'leaching time 120 min', 'solvent extraction time 30 min', 'crystallization time 120 min'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['lithium-rich cathode material']}

The four solid chlorinating agents were systematically compared in terms of the direct chlorination capacities, indirect chlorination capacities, alloy physical losses and chemical losses in the slag. CaCl2 was better suited for use as a solid chlorinating agent to promote Li volatilization due to its excellent results in these indexes. The temperature required for the release of HCl from MgCl2, facilitated by CO2 and SiO2, was lower than 500 °C. The prematurely released HCl failed to participate in the chlorination reaction. This resulted in approximately 12 % less Li volatilization when MgCl2 was used as a chlorinating agent compared to when CaCl2 was used. In addition, the use of KCl as a chlorinating agent decreased the chemical dissolution loss of alloys in the slag. The performance of NaCl was mediocre.

Prior to the flotation separation of spent LIBs, pyrolysis pretreatment plays a critical role in the removal of organic binding components from the particle surface. However, the presence of residual impurities on the material's surface can hinder the flotation process. This study proposes an environmentally friendly approach to recycling spent LIBs by combining pyrolysis with grinding, ultrasonic treatment, and micro-nanobubbles (MNBs), utilizing the electrode active materials from the batteries as raw materials. Various analytical techniques, including X-ray Diffractometer (XRD), Field-emission Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy Disperse Spectroscopy (FSEM-EDS), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and contact angle measurements, are employed to analyze the samples. The experimental results reveal that the flotation performance is enhanced through the use of pyrolysis-grinding and pyrolysis-ultrasonic techniques combined with MNBs, resulting in improved recovery and metal content. The most optimal flotation performance is achieved with the pyrolysis-ultrasonic-MNBs method at a pyrolysis temperature and duration of 350 °C and 15 min, respectively, leading to an increase in the metal content of cathode materials from 65 ± 3 % to 95 ± 2 %.",,"{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['pyrolysis-ultrasonic-MNBs'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['350 °C and 15 min'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['cathode materials']}

The results indicate that the addition of DMF can enhance the separation of CAMs and Al foils by generating micro bubbles (Consisting of CH4, CO2, H2O, HF and CO) between them and about 98.93% of CAMs is recovered after the pyrolysis at 450 °C via facile screening process.

The TGA-MS and TGA-FTIR analyses imply that PVDF and DMF are the two main substances that underwent chemical reactions during the pyrolysis process, in which lots of micro bubbles are produced between CAMs and Al foils. In situ FTIR spectroscopy and quantum-chemical simulations indicate that the intermediate pyrolysis products of DMF can promote the thermal decomposition of PVDF, which also favors the efficient separation of CAMs and Al foils.

It is shown here that such a cathode can be efficiently recovered by direct lithiation in solution using LiI in different solvents (acetonitrile, ethanol, cyclohexane, methanol, DMSO and propan-1,2-ol) with optimized experimental parameters. The best electrochemical performance is obtained with ethanol, one of the greenest and cheapest solvents, without any additional heat treatment. More interestingly, the regeneration of LFP can be achieved directly with the material cast onto its aluminum collector, which paves the way to more efficient recycling preserving the whole electrode formulation and avoiding a new electrode casting.

The proposed system consists of three major processes: hydrogen roasting for Li extraction, NMC precursor crystallization, and wastewater electrolysis for chemical regeneration. First, the spent LIB is decomposed into metal oxide by hydrogen roasting, and water-soluble lithium oxide is firstly separated from the metal oxide mixture. The recovered LiOH slurry undergoes further crystallization for high purity recovery. Second, the remaining metal oxide mixture undergoes acid leaching process, and pH adjustment via NaOH injection is conducted for satisfying minimum pH condition for precursor crystallization.

Herein, we propose a novel recycling strategy that combines mechanochemical activation (MCA) with biomass reduction roasting. The optimized roasting conditions with MCA pretreatment achieve a 100 °C reduction in roasting temperature, a halving of biomass ratio and roasting time, compared to the case without activation. By analyzing the changes in physicochemical properties of mixed samples (cathode materials and biomass) under different activation conditions and their impacts, the action mechanism of MCA on biomass reduction roasting is revealed. The introduction of MCA pretreatment achieves milder roasting conditions by promoting homogeneous mixing and disrupting NCM crystal structures through the “pre-oxygen elements removal” process. Furthermore, mechanical treatment was applied to enhance the carbonated water leaching process.

Recycling is crucial not only for the recovery of critical metals like Co(II) and Li(I) from the cathode material as a secondary resource but also from an environmental perspective. This study explores the use of a series of aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) with synthesized tetrabutylphosphonium ionic liquids (ILs) and ammonium sulfate as extraction platforms for metals from LIB cathode. Firstly, liquid–liquid equilibrium phase diagrams for each ABS were established, and partitioning experiments were conducted to assess the Co(II), Ni(II), Mn(II), and Li(I) recovery efficiencies. We observed distinct partitioning behaviors for the metals, with tetrabutylphosphonium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate, [TBP][DTPA], showing recovery efficiencies exceeding 98% for Co(II), Ni(II), and Mn(II). At the same time, Li(I) was predominantly retained in the aqueous salt-rich phase. By fine-tuning ABS operational parameters such as pH, temperature, system composition, and phase ratio, we identified optimal conditions for extracting metals from the cathode material of lithium-cobalt-oxide (LCO) batteries using sulfate lixiviate. Introducing [TBP][DTPA] after the leaching process induced ABS, achieving remarkable recovery efficiency over 95% for Co(II) in the IL-rich phase, with all Li(I) remaining in the lower phase. Cobalt was subsequently extracted using oxalic acid to precipitate as Co-oxalate from concentrate, while Li(I) was isolated from the aqueous phase using ammonium carbonate. After the “cleaning” of the IL-rich phase, the [TBP][DTPA] was recovered and reused in four consecutive cycles, with small detected losses on the recovery efficiency of Co(II) and Li(I). Therefore, our innovative strategy combines sulfate-based lixiviants with IL-ABS technology, thereby enhancing selectivity and sustainability within one of the most efficient lixiviant systems widely employed in the industry.

Techno-economic optimisation of an electric booster-assisted Carnot battery integrated into different data centres,"The transition to intermittent renewable energies will necessitate the integration of storage. An interesting technology is the Carnot battery (CB), a novel power-to-heat-to-power system, capable of harnessing waste energy streams. While initial studies have indicated that, under ideal conditions, CB can be competitive with conventional technologies such as chemical batteries, their economic viability in real-world applications remains uncertain. To fill this gap, this work explores the techno-economic potential of electric booster-assisted CB integrated within data centres. Motivation for this case study is the recovery of waste heat, leading to an improved electrical storage efficiency. To maximise the energy self-sufficiency and the internal rate of return, we have applied multi-criteria optimisation to the system design, under three different thermal integration scenarios and for two sets of climatic conditions, using a thermodynamic model and time series from a real data centre. Our analyses suggest that current projections for electricity prices and CB costs yield payback periods exceeding a decade, but that these could fall below ten years if the CB capital costs were halved. Furthermore, it turns out that the choice of optimum charging system (i.e. right balance between heat pump and electrical heater) is contingent on the heat source temperature and availability. For higher temperatures (e.g. 60 °C), heat pumps emerge as the financially most attractive option, thanks to their superior coefficient of performance, whereas for lower temperatures ( < 25 °C), resistive heaters are preferable. Results also show that when the aim is to increase the energy self-sufficiency, there exist an efficiency/charging capacity trade-off, which causes a dilemma for the system design. On the one hand, heat pumps are vital to increase the efficiency of the CB, but on the other hand, as the amount of thermal energy available at its source is limited by the data centre operations, electrical boosters are indispensable to increase the charging capacity. To soften this dilemma and enhance the techno-economic performance of thermally integrated CB, future research should explore more efficient booster configurations, such as dual heat source heat pumps.",,"{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['lithium-ion batteries'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['hydrometallurgical leaching and electrochemical deposition'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['HCl: H2O ratio 3:1', 'pH 1.0', '25 °C', '30 min leaching time', '95 % of the Li and Co were leached'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['cathode active material']}

This paper investigates tuning the sensitivity and selectivity performance of chemo-resistive sensors to detect volatile organic compound (VOC) biomarkers using a hybridized material of pristine graphene (pG) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NP) recovered from spent Zn–C batteries. This hybridized graphene nanocomposite material of ZnO nanoparticles showed enhanced sensing performance because of high conductive property of graphene along with the synergetic interplay between graphene composite materials and ZnO NPs. The elevated surface area as well as adsorption capability of ZnO NPs provided improved sensitivity and selectivity for particular VOCs. It was proposed that this hybridized material could be used to fabricate chemo-resistive sensors with sensing performances tailored for VOC biomarker detection. To test this hypothesis, the ability of graphene hybrid nanocomposites with ZnO NPs to improve the sensing characteristics and efficiency of distinguishing diverse VOC biomarkers such as ethanol, acetone, methanol, chloroform, acetonitrile and terahydrofuran (THF) was investigated.

Nearly all references believe that aluminium-doped LiFePO4 is a solid solution and that the material capacity increases firstly before decreasing with aluminium content. However, their reported performance of the aluminium-free LiFePO4 as a comparison is far lower than commercial LiFePO4 currently manufactured at large scales. Thus, conclusions drawn based on such a comparison are questionable. To better understand the effects of aluminium on LiFePO4 electrochemical performance, we first tracked aluminium behaviour in FePO4·2H2O, FePO4 precursors and LiFePO4 product. In FePO4·2H2O prepared from aqueous solution, aluminium exists as AlPO4·2H2O in two types (monoclinic and orthorhombic systems) of solid solutions (Fe1-xAlxPO4·2H2O). In Fe1-xAlxPO4 dehydrated from Fe1-xAlxPO4·2H2O, trigonal AlPO4 and FePO4 firstly form a solid solution (Fe1-xAlxPO4, berlinite). At higher aluminium content (x ≥ 0.026), additional AlPO4 forms an independent phase in monoclinic system. In Li1-xFe1-xAlxPO4/C (x = 0–0.048), no evidence of solid solution formation was observed. Secondly, the effects of aluminium on Li1-xFe1-xAlxPO4/C electrochemical performance were studied. It is found that, material specific discharge capacity only decreases monotonically with addition of aluminium at optimal calcination temperature (as 760 °C), unlike references, which “increases firstly before decreasing”.

Accordingly, the conversion type copper oxide (CuO) and insertion host, graphite (RG) are formulated as composite via mechanical milling and employed as active material. Both RG and CuO have been recovered/regenerated from the anodic active material, and the Cu-foil current collector of spent Li-ion batteries is worth mentioning.

However, for practical application, the adsorbent materials need to be shaped into granules, spheres, or foams using binding materials, which can reduce the adsorption performance by blocking adsorption sites. To overcome this drawback, an alternative method is proposed herein whereby the adsorbent lithium manganese oxide (LMO) powder is loaded into a multi-stage column (MSC) system equipped with a fabric filter.

By comparison, stirring the adsorbent powder in solution for the same adsorption time yielded 22.8 mg g−1. The MSC adsorption process fits well with the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo second-order kinetics. To confirm the feasibility of the proposed method, its performance is also evaluated in the extraction of Li+ from natural seawater, giving Li+ recoveries ranging from 4 to 4.9 mg g−1 during repeated adsorption/desorption runs.

The electrical and thermal properties of tin-phosphate materials were investigated by electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and thermogravimetry – differential thermal analysis – mass spectroscopy (TG–DTA–MS). Moreover, the local structure of xSnP was characterized by 119Sn-Mössbauer and magic angle spinning (MAS) 31P NMR spectroscopies. Homogeneous glasses were obtained for xSnP with ‘x’ from 50 to 80, while Sn(HPO4), SnO2, and Sn3(PO4)2 nanoparticles formed in 40SnP and 90SnP compositions, respectively. The nano-crystallized 40SnP and 90SnP samples showed large electrical conductivity (σ) of 2.02×10−5 and 1.04×10−4 S cm−1 due to the conductive crystalline phases of SnP2O7 and defective SnO2, respectively. The lower σ of about 10−8 S cm−1 were recorded for xSnP with ‘x’ from 50 to 80 owing to the decomposition of the 3D network built by phosphate tetrahedrons. 119Sn-Mössbauer spectra proved the growing number of SnIVO6 units, which do not contribute to the rise of electrical conductivity. On the other hand, larger σ values of 1.79×10−4 and 6.4×10−3 S cm−1 were confirmed for 40SnP and 90SnP samples after heat treatment, resulting in partial reduction of SnIV to SnII and growing of the 3D network structure by PO4 3−.

The process comprises an acid leaching followed by the resynthesis of a cathode material from the resulting leachate. Spent cathode materials were leached in citric acid (C6H8O7) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Optimal leaching conditions were obtained at a leaching temperature of 90 °C, a H2O2 concentration of 1.5 vol%, a leaching time of 60 min, a pulp density of 20 g L−1, and a citric acid concentration of 0.5 M. The leaching efficiencies of Li, Co, Ni, and Mn exceeded 95%. The leachate was used to resynthesize new LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 material by using a sol–gel method. A comparison of the electrochemical properties of the resynthesized material (NCM-spent) with that synthesized directly from original chemicals (NCM-syn) indicated that the initial discharge capacity of NCM-spent at 0.2 C was 152.8 mA h g−1, which was higher than the 149.8 mA h g−1 of NCM-syn.

In Indonesia, the risk of exposure is high due to the inappropriate recycling of used lead batteries. The objective was to investigate the factors that influence lead levels in children's blood. Methods This cross-sectional study assessed blood lead levels (BLLs) in children aged 12–59 months in four communities exposed to used lead-acid batteries (ULABs) recycling activities, comparing them to a control area. The study employed a threshold level of 20 μg/dL to identify high BLLs and utilized a sample size of 324 children from exposed sites and 240 from control sites. Questionnaires, blood lead tests and a home-based assessment for environmental exposures were applied. Results The study participants comprised 295 boys and 269 girls, with an average age of 35 months. Significant disparities in soil lead concentrations median: Q1-Q3 were found between exposed (6581.7 : 2432.6–16647.1) ppm and control areas (253.5 : 158.8–417.1) ppm. Children in exposed areas had 3.9 times higher odds of BLL ≥20 μg/dL. Fathers with BLL ≥20 μg/dL had children with similarly elevated BLLs. Multivariate analysis identified socioeconomic status, study areas, environmental factors (cookware, food ware, spices, house cleaning), and children's behavior (breastfeeding duration) as determinants of elevated BLLs. Reported environmental factors had notable impact on BLLs, with aluminum cookware (aOR = 1.4, 95%CI [1.2–1.6]), food ware materials (aOR = 1.15, 95%CI [1.0–1.3]), type of spices (aOR = 2.7, 95%CI [1.7–48.0]), and house cleaning method (aOR = 2.9, 95%CI [1.2–7.1]). Conclusion This study highlighted key risk factors affecting children's blood lead levels (BLL) and emphasized the urgency of employing effective strategies to remediate lead-contaminated soils in exposed regions.

Additionally, the use of new carbon materials in electrode materials for ternary lithium batteries, referred to as LIBs, is increasing. These materials typically have high porosity and a large specific surface area. In this study, two types of nanoporous carbon (NC) commonly used in electrodes, namely Al-PCP-800 and ZIF-8–800, were prepared to investigate their effects on the carbothermic reduction stage of recycling spent batteries.

Herein, a stepwise conversion from surface cationic-anionic redox to inside electrochemical displacement reaction is realized in copper selenide (Cu2-xSe) superstructure cathodes. A highly reversible high-voltage platform at ∼1.6 V is discovered during discharge process. Ex-situ spectroscopy and microscopy results demonstrate that the high-voltage plateau is contributed by surface Cu2+ charge-carrier transformation and anionic Se2– redox reaction while sufficient inner Cu-Mg replacement conversion at low-voltage region.

Thus, the extraction of these metals from spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has gained much attention since they are present in relatively high concentrations in the cathode of the battery. Chlorination roasting is an attractive technique of metal extraction because of its salient features: short reaction times and moderate reaction temperatures, selectivity to the extraction of certain metals and in many cases implies the use of low-cost chlorinating reactants. However, there are few studies concerning the recycling of metals through chlorination roasting. This research paper evaluates the chlorination roasting using MgCl2·6H2O as chlorinating reactant followed by water-leaching to recycle lithium and cobalt from the cathode material of spent LIBs. First, a non-isothermal chlorination test between 20 and 900 °C was performed to evaluate how temperature affects the chlorination of the metals and the presence of impurities. Then, isothermal chlorination tests at 420, 440 and 470 °C for times between 60 and 350 min were performed to evaluate the effect of time on the purity of the product. It was found that the chlorination treatment is selective to lithium. HCl(g) generated during the decomposition of MgCl2·6H2O reacts with lithium to produce LiCl. Cobalt is extracted as Co3O4, as it is another product of the chlorination reaction. The product of LiCl impurified with Mg(OH)Cl, formed during the extraction process, was purified by a heat treatment in air at 570 °C for 60 min followed by water-leaching. This treatment also generates MgO as a by-product. The optimum conditions of the extractive process were the followings: 440 °C and 210 min. The extraction yields of lithium and cobalt were 83.29% and 89.66%, respectively. The recycling process proposed here proved to be efficient.

Simultaneously, it addresses the growing demand for high-performance anode materials by leveraging renewable waste feedstocks. Sugarcane bagasse waste residues obtained after furfural extraction were used as the precursor. The furfural-derived bagasse residue (FDBR) underwent pyrolysis at 700 °C to produce a carbon-rich char, which was further activated using KOH and steam at 900 °C for 15–60 minutes to enhance porosity development. Comprehensive physicochemical characterizations, including proximate analysis, N2 adsorption-desorption, SEM-EDX, FTIR, and TGA/DTG, and Raman spectroscopy were performed to evaluate the properties of the synthesized activated carbons. The results demonstrated the successful generation of high surface area (405.8 m2/g) activated carbons with a hierarchical pore structure comprising micropores and mesopores. SEM and EDX analyses revealed a uniform, porous morphology enriched with 10.41 % at oxygen-containing functional groups. FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of hydroxyls, carbonyls, and carboxylic acid groups, beneficial for pseudocapacitive charge storage. The Raman analysis revealed a highly disordered and amorphous carbon structure with a significant concentration of defects, as evidenced by a high-intensity ratio (ID/IG ≈ 1.2–1.4) of the disordered carbon band to the graphitic band. The activated carbons exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 1055 mAh/g in lithium half-cells, significantly exceeding the theoretical limit of commercial graphite anodes (372 mAh/g). This superior capacity was attributed to the high surface area, hierarchical porosity, and pseudocapacitive contributions from the oxygen functionalities. However, rapid capacity fading from 1055 to ∼250 mAh/g was observed over 100 cycles at a C/2 rate. The capacity retention stabilized at ∼88 % after 47 cycles, indicating irreversible capacity losses. These limitations were ascribed to the disordered amorphous structure, instability of the solid-electrolyte interphase, lithium trapping by oxygen groups, and structural changes during cycling. Optimizing activation conditions, incorporating conductive additives/coatings, exploring alternative binders, and surface functionalization are proposed to improve long-term cycling stability.

In this work, a novel method of NH4HSO4 reduction roasting-selective ammonia leaching was proposed to thoroughly separate Li and Mn from the spent LiMn2O4 cathode materials. Using the TG-DSC-FTIR, XRD, SEM-EDS and ICP methods, the detailed mechanism of reduction roasting process was revealed, showing that the Mn4+ and Mn3+ in the spinel structure of LiMn2O4 were reduced by the NH4 + from the molten ammonium salt, and transformed into water-soluble MnSO4 and Li2Mn2(SO4)3. According to the water-leaching performance of the roasting products, the sulfation conversion rate of Mn reaches 98.1 %, while Li is almost completely transformed under the optimal roasting conditions (475 ℃, 60 min). Using the NH3·H2O-air leaching-system, complete separation of Li and Mn can be achieved. It was shown that the introduction of air into the ammonia solution at a rate of 0.2 L/min under the optimal leaching condition leads to Mn precipitation in the form of nanoscale Mn3O4 particles with a precipitation rate of over 99.99 %, while Li still remains completely leached. Based on the in situ detection of the oxidation reduction potential and pH during the selective leaching, the key mechanism of efficient Mn precipitation was revealed. that is, the increasing potential accelerates the oxidation of Mn(OH)2, and the rapid consumption of Mn(OH)2 promotes the hydrolysis of Mn2+, thereby achieving a significant improvement in the separation efficiency of Li and Mn.",,"{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['lithium-ion batteries'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['roasting-selective ammonia leaching'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['475 ℃', '60 min'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['Mn3O4']}

The investigated process variables include reductive agent concentrations (Fe2+, Cu, H2O2) as well as process temperature, whereas S/L ratio (200 g/L) and initial acidity (2 M H2SO4) were kept constant. At lower temperatures (T = 30 °C), copper was found to act as the predominant reductant, enabled by the presence of sufficient solution iron concentrations (≥0.4 g/L Fe). Conversely, at higher temperatures (T ≥ 50 °C), the reductive capability of aluminum was substantially increased due to its decreased tendency for passivation. In contrast to copper, dissolved iron did not notably affect the reductive behavior of aluminum. The efficiency of metallic reductants initially present within the black mass was high, reaching cathode metal leaching yields above 90 % at 70 °C. A predictive leaching model for black mass leaching yields was built via regression analysis and can be used to indicate pregnant leach solution (PLS) composition – via leaching yields – after two hours of processing as a function of the investigated process variables. The model showed leaching temperature to be the most impactful parameter, while also indicating a higher reductive efficiency of copper when compared to equimolar additions of H2O2.

The HC carbonized at 1000℃ delivers a reversible capacity of 337 mAh/g with capacity retention of 88% after 100 cycles at 30 mAh/g. The HC exhibits 80% capacity retention even after 1000 cycles at a 1C rate and is promising for fast cycling-high power density applications.

Roasting was performed at various temperatures (350–900 °C), for various times (60–360 min), and under various oxygen fugacity (air or O2) conditions. The chemical speciation of each metal element after roasting was determined by sequential elemental leaching tests and X-ray diffraction analysis. Li formed sulfates or phosphates over a wide temperature range. Ni and Co followed very complicated reaction paths owing to coexistence of S, P, and C, and they formed sulfides, phosphates, and complex oxides. The optimum conditions for minimizing formation of insoluble compounds, such as complex oxides, were a roasting temperature of 450–500 °C and a roasting time of 120 min. The results indicated that although ASS-LIBs can be treated by the same roasting processes as those used for current liquid-based LIBs, the optimal roasting conditions have narrow ranges.

These facilitate converting microwave energy into heat and achieve higher heating rates (maximum 720 °C/min, microwave power: 800 W) to promote biomass pyrolysis. Furthermore, these biochar materials realized higher yields of H2-rich syngas and lower yields of liquid products than the original biochar and commercial SiC in MACP of rice straw at 360 W (< 350 °C), depicting enhanced catalytic activity and product selectivity.

EG serves as a filler that enhances the thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of materials. The focus was put on the optimization of the composition of SSPCM including PW, and EG, to check thermal, mechanical, and rheological properties which influence the future processability of such systems through extrusion, as well as to investigate the synergic effect of graphite and residual Al component on thermal conductivity and leakage of PW. There are two main demands on polymer/PW blends, namely well-separated melting peaks for both components at significantly different temperatures, and good compatibility between polymer and PW. The best performance of SSPCM investigated in this study was found for a mixture having the composition TP/PW/EG = 50/40/10 w/w/w. This mixture shows well-balanced properties, including appropriate heat storage and release parameters, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, toughness and strength, and low leakage of PW from the material.

Herein, the quantitative relationship between Al in the leaching solution and regenerated precursors and cathode materials is investigated, and the effects of Al impurity on the macromorphology and microstructure of the materials is revealed. It suggests that Al introduction suppresses the ordered growth of precursors and further leads to disordered grain morphology of regenerated cathode materials, twisting Li+ diffusion pathway.

Based on theoretical calculations, we have systematically studied the performance of the 2D-FeS2 monolayer as cathode material for Li-S batteries from five aspects: obtainability of structure, thermodynamic stability, electrical, surface activity, and electrochemical properties. Simulation results show that the 2D-FeS2 monolayer structure is easy to form due to the small exfoliation energy and interlayer binding energy. The layered structure surface enhances the anchoring effect of polysulfide. Excellent stability was verified by tdynamics simulation. Additionally, the DOS results show that the 2D-FeS2 monolayer has higher conductivity, which effectively improves the mobility of Li+ and electrons. The theoretical specific capacity of the 2D-FeS2 monolayer is 446.96 mAh/g, and the lower Li+ diffusion barrier is 0.19 eV. Compared to traditional FeS2, the 2D-FeS2 monolayer has higher conductivity and stability. In brief, the 2D-FeS2 monolayer is a promising cathode material for Li-S batteries. This work opens up a new path for the application of 2D materials to new energy batteries and also deepens our understanding of 2D materials at the nanoscale.",,"{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['chemical leaching'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['pH value of 1.5', 'oxidizing agent of H2O2'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['lithium sulfate']}

Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry investigation indicates that all batteries analyses contain Ni, Cu, As, Sr, and Ba and most of the batteries have detectable quantities of Pb (92%), Cr (88%) and Co (88%). Roughly half of the batteries analyzed contain detectable quantities of Hg (52%) and V (56%). Tl occurs in 64% of batteries but at very low concentrations (0.1–1.1ppm). Cd and Se were less common occurring in only 8% and 12% of batteries respectively. Some samples are arguably low in heavy metal content with 28% of the batteries having a sum of less than 100ppm of the analyzed metals. The origin of the heavy metal concentrations is interpreted to be largely from original geologic sources of material. Scanning electron microscopy indicates that heavy metals are largely in solid solution in the phases in the battery materials and rarely exist as discrete particulate materials and suggests that mechanical separation of heavy metals for recycling purposes is therefore not feasible. Although batteries from several sources have heavy metal concentrations of concern, batteries from China are generally characterized by having relatively high heavy metal content. These products are introduced into waste streams in countries where respective domestic manufacturers must meet a much higher environmental standard. Results of this study suggest an environmental global standard should be developed and the data presented here may serve as a reference for development of such a standard.

Although numerous instances of utilizing biomass-derived hard carbon in SIBs have been observed, the unregulated pore structure of these hard carbon materials significantly constrains the electrochemical performance of SIBs, leading to diminished initial Columbic efficiency (ICE) and plateau capacity. Herein, taking a biomass hard carbon derived from waste camellia seed shells (CSSHCs) as a template, we display a correlation between synthesis conditions and pore structure of CSSHCs. CSSHCs are synthesized via a facile route including pre‑carbonization, purifying, mechanical ball-milling and high-temperature carbonization, and it is found that adjusting the secondary calcination temperature can induce the formation of closed pore structure, which is of great benefit to increase the ICE and the plateau-capacity.

When concerns about environment and shortage of graphite resources become the main objective, then recycling of anode materials can play a significant role in this case. In this work, the graphite anode powder was recycled from LIBs in a very simple procedure including sequence steps of separation, dispersion and heat treatment. The reclaimed anode graphite powder was dispersed in ethanol then centrifuged five times, followed by a heat treatment process at 800 °C for 6 h under continuous nitrogen flow. Recycled graphite was directly used to synthesize hybrid composites by extrusion process. This type of graphite/polymer composites has the potential to be used as conductive polymer composites (CPCs). These composites have versatile functionalities that allow them to be used in several applications such as interference shielding and electrostatic dissipation. The structure, morphology, mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of the hybrid composites were analyzed by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, electron microscope, universal testing machine (UTM) and two probe method. Results showed that mechanical properties of the polymer were significantly improved with the increasing content of the recycled graphite. Morphology also indicated that the recycled graphite was homogeneously distributed in the polymer matrix compared to commercial graphite. Interesting results were observed in mechanical properties when the tensile strength and elongation percentage were compared between composites made from commercial graphite and recycled graphite. Recycled graphite based hybrid composite shows higher elongation and tensile strength compared to commercial graphite based hybrid composite.

Therefore, it is much imperative and urgent to develop the green technology for regenerating and recycling these scrapped LiFePO4 batteries. Herein, we reported an efficient and straightforward solid-phase strategy to achieve the direct regeneration of scrapped LiFePO4 cathode materials. The decommissioned LiFePO4 was successfully regenerated by adding lithium carbonate and melamine under the heat treatment condition, and the battery performance was repaired. The electrochemical performance of regenerated LiFePO4 is even higher than that of the unused LiFePO4 at 0.05 C. Moreover, the regenerated LiFePO4 also exhibits excellent capacity preservation rate of 99.03 % after 200 cycles and outstanding rate capability at 5 C with a discharge capacity of 116 mAh/g.

However, FPCMs based on high thermal conductivity fillers and polymers always suffer from the enduring challenges of poor high-temperature resistance and poor filler-matrix compatibility. To solve these problems, a novel strategy is reported in this work, wherein FPCMs with excellent filler-matrix compatibility and satisfactory high-temperature resistance are synthesized by two steps: functionalizing the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) surface and inducing the inter crosslinking between Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene(SBS) and Low-density polyethylene(LDPE). Vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) molecules were introduced on the surface of raw hBN by hydroxylation and silanization surface modification to improve the compatibility of hBN with the matrix. Concluding from the results, the addition of 6.7 wt% LDPE doubled the high-temperature resistance of FPCMs, enabling them to maintain their structural integrity even at 200 °C for 1 h.

This paper examines the global demand for 25 potentially scarce materials that would result from an energy system that is compatible with the 1.5 °C target. It further analyses the risk for short- and mid-term material shortages. To determine the material requirements, an extensive prospective database was built up on the specific demand of these materials in key technologies. A second database describes the potential development of sub-technology market shares within a technology class. A material flow analysis model was used to determine the annual and cumulative material requirements as well as the recycling potential in the underlying scenario. The results show that production of all materials has to increase, in some cases significantly, in a short period of time to meet the demand for the energy and transportation system. In addition, the cumulative demand for some materials significantly exceeds current reserves and even resources. In particular, lithium (demand increase (DI) more than factor 10, cumulated demand (CD) exceeds reserves up to factor 2), cobalt (DI/CD: <7/<3), and nickel (CD/DI: <2.4/<1.4) for batteries, dysprosium (DI < 8) and neodymium (DI < 1.5) (for permanent magnets (wind turbines and electric motors), and iridium (DI < 2.9) as well as platinum (DI < 1.8) (fuel cells, electrolyzers) are affected. The construction of battery electric and fuel cell electric vehicles thus represents a major driver of the material demand. Depending on the material, shortages can be reduced or delayed by technology substitution, material recycling, technology lifetime extension, increased material efficiency, and a smaller future vehicle stock, but not entirely avoided.

Typically, an Li source is required to address the vacant Li defects in spent cathodes for regeneration, while the removal of residual Li is crucial for regenerating spent anodes. Here, given our discovery that approximately 65 % of the residual Li in spent graphite demonstrates reactivity with water, we propose a straightforward water extraction method for purifying and regenerating spent graphite anode. By carefully controlling the concentrations of OH- and Li+ ions in the obtained Li-rich solution, it can be directly used to relithiate spent NCM cathodes. In this method, Li+ ions lost from the cathode during electrochemical cycling were reintroduced back into the cathode via aqueous relithiation, eliminating the need for additional Li sources to repair the Li deficiencies in spent cathode, effectively reducing recycling costs and minimizing the environmental impact associated with raw materials. The regenerated NCM cathode and graphite anode demonstrated specific capacities of 163 mAh/g and 386 mAh/g at a rate of 0.1C, respectively, both reaching the performance levels of pristine materials.

Under optimized experimental conditions, the lithium sorption isotherm highlighted a maximum adsorption capacity of 0.075 mmol/g polymer (0.55 mg.g−1), which is in the lower limit compared to similar CE studies reported in the literature. Moreover, competitive sorption studied in multicomponent solutions (Li, Co, Ni, Mn) simulating lithium-ion batteries (LIB) leachates (containing mostly lithium and cobalt), as well as in solutions with increased amounts of nickel and manganese, showed that selectivity towards lithium (and to a lesser extent cobalt) appeared to depend on the relative concentration of these two elements compared to Ni and Mn. In leachate-like conditions, the copolymer showed selectivity towards Li and Co whereas the selectivity evolved towards Ni and Mn as the initial concentration of Ni and Mn increased. DLS and ITC measurements were undergone to comprehend the obtained sorption capacities and selectivity from a mechanistic and thermodynamic point of view. While DLS measurements indicated potential salting-out effect of the ions causing degradation of water and metal interactions with the CEs, ITC experiments shed light on the potential culprit: the rigidity and hydrophobicity of the benzo-group.",,"{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['thermochemical method'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['1200 °C'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['Li2CO3']}

Sodium can play a critical role in a plethora of rechargeable batteries as they are more abundant, economical, have better safety characteristics, and have similar power delivery possibilities. In this work, we established the intercalation of the sodium ions in between selectively functionalized graphene oxide (GO) layers for a Na-ion battery with enhanced performance. GO was functionalized by reacting with N-Boc-ethylenediamine (EnBoc) which resulted in the formation of amino alcohol moieties offering three coordination sites for sodium ions. This synthetic approach led to the formation of Na-GO-EnBoc material by increasing the interlayer d-spacing from 9.7 Å to 13.17 Å (2θ = 6.7 deg.) which facilitated more Na+ ions to intercalate efficiently in between GO nanosheets. The insertion of sodium ions on the surface of intercalated GO-EnBoc nanosheets was performed by the precursor sodium perchlorate in ethylene carbonate. The resultant Na-GO-EnBoc material was characterized by using solid state MAS NMR, XPS, XRD, IR, Raman, and microscopy. The analysis suggested different types of Na+ ions on the interlayer gallery which was also substantiated by DFT calculations.

The newly synthesized material exhibits well-balanced mechanical properties, with Young’s modulus, strength, and toughness of 109 MPa, 32 MPa, and 242 MJm−3, respectively. The Young’s modulus and yield strength of double network material are 137% and 100% higher, respectively than those of the material with a metal-coordination single network. The transparent film based on double network material exhibits high potential for application in display films, because of its colorless nature and energy-absorbing impact-protection property. Shear rheological characterization confirms the high melt strength and elasticity of the new CDB-based material, which can be processed by a wide range of techniques, including foam molding.

In the present contribution, we construct an asymmetric Janus MoB structure functionalized with bifunctional groups to improve the electrochemical performance, and the electronic, adsorption and diffusion properties of MoBXY are investigated by first-principles method. The results reveal that the diffusion barriers of Li ions on the surface of O and S are 0.38 and 0.36 eV, respectively, the values are significantly lower than 0.55 eV of initial MoB, which is conducive to rapid charge and discharge of the battery. The specific capacity is increased to 519 mAh/g compared with the original one, and the metal ions are evenly distributed on the electrode surface. Additionally, the open circuit voltage (OCV) is in the range of 0–1 V, preventing the formation of Li dendrites and ensuring the safety of the battery in operation. These properties are attributed to the functionalized Janus structure redistributing the surface charge of the material, resulting in an evenly uniform interaction force between the adsorbed atoms and the matrix, thereby improving the adsorption stability of lithium ions.

As one of the most promising anode materials in PIBs, hard carbon (HC) has been prepared from various sources but exhibited varying electrochemical performance, probably due to a limited understanding of materials structure and K-ion storage mechanisms. Especially, biomass (such as lignin) represents an abundant source for synthesizing HC. However, few studies have investigated the role of lignin molecular weight (MW) in determining HC’s structure and eventually ion storage mechanism. Herein, we developed a series of HCs from lignin with different MWs at serial pyrolysis temperatures and correlated the lignin MWs and pyrolysis temperatures with HC’s structure, electrochemical performance, and K-ion storage mechanisms. The best lignin-derived HC delivered a high reversible specific capacity of ~300 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1. Moreover, a binary K-ion storage mechanism of “bulk insertion + surface adsorption” was fortified in lignin-derived HCs, and the contributions of each storage behavior were quantified via kinetics calculations for the first time. It was found that lignin with medium MW (9660 g mol−1) pyrolyzed at medium temperatures (700 °C) yielded HC with an optimal mixture of graphite-like nanocrystals with the largest interlayer distance and amorphous structure to maximize K-ion storage from both bulk-insertion and surface-adsorption mechanisms.

Lithium – sulphur battery is far more environmentally friendly as it uses only scarce lithium, has significantly higher specific energy density than Li ion cells, and easier to recycle. A facile one step scalable process has been developed to increase the loading and conductivity of sulphur; retard long chain polysulphides shuttling, tackle volumetric fluctuation of active particles and inhibit the lithium anode corrosion together with its dendritic growth during discharge – charge cycles. Electrode with EA-PAA binder delivers discharge capacity ∼836 mAh/g at 0.2C which is significantly larger than electrode made with PAA binder (∼745 mAh/g). At 1C rate electrode with EA-PAA binder delivers a discharge capacity ∼418 mAh/g which is significantly larger than electrode made using PAA binder (∼257 mAh/g). Irrespective of measured current, electrode with EA-PAA binder yields superior coulombic efficiency than electrode made using PAA binder. It is argued that the developed S/C composite with rGO additive and EA-PAA binder yields polar – polar interaction between EA-PAA binder and soluble long chain polysulphides to retard their shuttling. The EA-PAA binder with polar functional groups also have stronger bonding with underlying Al current collector. The stretchable EA-PAA binder network efficiently buffer the volumetric strain during alloying and de – alloying reactions as compare to PAA electrode.

The structural and textural properties of materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N2 adsorption/desorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

Based on this mechanism, the key parameters affecting the peel-off efficiency of cathode materials from Al foil was identified as solvent nature, temperature, ultrasonic power, and ultrasonic time. The peel-off efficiency of cathode materials achieved ∼99% under the optimized conditions of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) cleaning fluid, 70°C process temperature, 240W ultrasonic power, and 90min of ultrasonication.

Besides, elevated operating temperatures can lead to a battery thermal runaway and performance degradation.

Biotests are relevant for evaluating waste complex matrices, but their efficiency is crucial to encourage their adoption at the industrial level. This work aims at evaluating possibilities of improving the efficiency of a biotest battery previously suggested in the literature, regarding test selection, duration, and/or laboratory resources optimization. Fresh incineration bottom ash (IBA) was the case study. The test battery analysed included standard aquatic (bacteria, microalgae, macrophytes, daphnids, rotifers, fairy shrimp) and terrestrial (bacteria, plants, earthworms, collembolans) organisms. The assessment followed an Extended Limit Test design (three dilutions of eluate or solid IBA) and the Lowest Ineffective Dilution (LID-approach) for ecotoxicity classification. The results emphasize the importance of testing different species. It was also evidenced that tests with daphnids and earthworms may be shortened to 24 h; the miniaturization of tests is suitable as e.g. differential sensitivity of microalgae and macrophytes was captured with low variability; alternative testing kits can be used when methodological difficulties are found. Microalgae were more sensitive than macrophytes. Similar results were found for the Thamnotoxkit and daphnids test for eluates with natural pH, so the former may be used as an alternative. B. rapa was the most sensitive organism, suggesting that it may be tested as the only terrestrial plant species and that minimum test duration is appropriate. F. candida does not appear to add information to the battery. The differences in sensitivity of A. fischeri and E. fetida compared to the remaining species were not significant enough to exclude them from the battery. Thus, this work suggests a biotest battery to test IBA comprising aquatic tests - Aliivibrio fischeri, Raphidocelis subcapitata (miniaturised test), and Daphnia magna (24 h when clear deleterious effects are observed) or Thamnocephalus platyurus (toxkit) – and terrestrial tests – Arthrobacter globiformis, Brassica rapa (14 d), and Eisenia fetida (24 h). Testing waste with natural pH is also recommended. The Extended Limit Test design considering the LID-approach seems useful in waste testing, particularly for the industry, involving low effort, test material requirements, and few laboratory resources.

In this work, the effect of synthesis conditions upon the primary and agglomerated secondary particle size and shape of the sodium-ion cathode material NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 was investigated for optimization of energy and cycle life. A two-level full factorial experimental design was utilized to examine how the synthesis parameters (pH, molar ratio of ammonia/metal precursor salt, and stirring speed) affect the physical and electrochemical properties. This approach enabled a comprehensive investigation of the main effects and interactions of these parameters. The data from multiple synthesis runs were analyzed using statistical methods and regression analysis. This experimental design provided valuable insights into the relationship between synthesis parameters and material properties. Statistical analysis indicates that both physical and electrochemical properties are mainly controlled through pH and NH4OH, while the effects of stirring speed are less pronounced.

It is also pertinent to note that batteries are imperative for enabling electric vehicles, which can help reduce dependency on fossil fuels and decrease carbon emissions. Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) are widely deployed energy-storing devices that dominate the battery market featuring so far the highest energy density among other conventional systems along with long cycle life and power density. Despite this, LiBs are not able to provide sufficient energy density having reached their practical energy density limit, which is an obstacle for their use in Electric Vehicles (EVs) for long driving ranges or other high end electronic devices. Their limited reserves are also jeopardizing its industry. Hence, solutions need to be explored to enhance its energy density by investigating high performance materials, all while utilizing the existing infrastructure for these batteries. As a result, the world is looking for high performance next-generation batteries. The Lithium-Sulfur Battery (LiSB) is one of the alternatives receiving attention as they offer a solution for next-generation energy storage systems because of their high specific capacity (1675 mAh/g), high energy density (2600 Wh/kg) and abundance of sulfur in nature. These qualities make LiSBs extremely promising as the upcoming high-energy storing technology. Therefore, LiSBs are emerging as the next-generation batteries as they are able to provide high capacity at a lower cost. The sulfur that is used as the cathode in LiSBs is less expensive than the cobalt used in LiBs. Nevertheless, several obstacles must be addressed to render them a feasible choice for real-world implementations. The sulfur cathode encounters numerous obstacles such as high-volume increase, lower conductivity, and shuttling effect resulting from the dissolution and movement of polysulfides (PS).

Experimental results showed that the Mn-rich slag was sensitive to acidic conditions which induced the dissolution of primary phases. Moreover, pH 4 conditions did not result in the formation of newly formed solid products, leading to the greatest mobilization of metallic elements (especially Mn). Alkaline conditions favored the precipitation of secondary phases, especially rhodochrosite, calcite and Mg-saponite, inducing low mobilization of the contained elements.

Although featuring with simplified process, direct regeneration technology still fails to bypass high-temperature driving forces for Li+ compensation of degraded cathodes. Herein, chemical re-lithiation strategy mediated by ferrocene is proposed to directly regenerate the Li-deficient spent cathodes. Ferrocene and its derivatives, the so-called p-type redox mediators, can be oxidized spontaneously from neutral molecules to stable cations under ambient conditions, allowing them to function as electron donors. Meanwhile, lithium salts serve as Li+ donors to ensure charge neutrality of the cathode lattice. The effects of solvation and substituent are thoroughly investigated to precisely regulate the potential of a series of ferrocene-based reductants. Chemical re-lithiation is driven thermodynamically by the intrinsic potential gap between ferrocene and degraded cathodes, thus fundamentally realizing a rapid lithiation reaction (taking less than 20 min at 25 °C), while avoiding the involvement of high-temperature operation. Diverse characterizations have been performed to explore the Li+-electron concerted re-lithiation mechanism. The regenerated LiFePO4 cathode demonstrated comparable Li+ storage capability to commercial cathode. Life-cycle analysis verifies the economical and environmental superiority of our chemical re-lithiation strategy to metallurgy in practical industry.

Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a highly promising energy storage solution due to their promising performance over a wide range of temperatures and the abundance of sodium resources in the earth's crust. Compared to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), although sodium ions possess a larger ionic radius, they are more easily desolvated than lithium ions. Furthermore, SIBs have a smaller Stokes radius than lithium ions, resulting in improved sodium-ion mobility in the electrolyte. Nevertheless, SIBs demonstrate a significant decrease in performance at low temperatures (LT), which constrains their operation in harsh weather conditions. Despite the increasing interest in SIBs, there is a notable scarcity of research focusing specifically on their mechanism under LT conditions. This review explores recent research that considers the thermal tolerance of SIBs from an inner chemistry process perspective, spanning a wide temperature spectrum (−70 to 100 °C), particularly at LT conditions. In addition, the enhancement of electrochemical performance in LT SIBs is based on improvements in reaction kinetics and cycling stability achieved through the utilization of effective electrode materials and electrolyte components. Furthermore, the safety concerns associated with SIBs are addressed and effective strategies are proposed for mitigating these issues.

The regeneration of spent graphite was done via acetic acid treatment, and the graphite/metal oxide composite was prepared by an ultrasonication route. The structural properties of the as-prepared composite materials are effectively influenced by the introduction of TiO2 and MnO2 particles as evidenced by the variation in the intensity of the diffraction peaks and the appearance of new peaks. The decoration of graphite flakes with metal oxide particles is demonstrated by morphological and mapping analysis. The optimum concentration of MnO2 particles is found to be 10 wt% in a graphite framework and results in good functional properties when compared with RG and a TiO2/RG composite. Finally, the optimized 10 wt% MnO2/RG composite displays excellent charge storage of 184 F/g in 1 M KOH electrolyte, which is greater than for the other graphite composite samples. The impact of MnO2 productively contributes to the excellent capacitance of graphite, which is due to greater grain conductivity, thus reducing the charge transfer resistance and providing a large contact area for storage of ions. As a result of this, a 10 wt% MnO2/RG-based symmetric supercapacitor shows the greatest electrochemical storage, which is 36.78 F/g.

Sulfuric acid treatment and subsequent pyrolysis of the masks resulted in polyaromatic and carbon structures, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies revealed that a longer sulfuric acid treatment time results in a higher carbon yield (up to 50%), indicating that the infusible structures generated during sulfonation played a critical role in the development of the resulting carbon. In addition, we confirmed the detailed mechanism by NMR analysis, which indicated that sulfonation induced not only simple cross-linking but also polyaromatic hydrocarbons, contributing to distinct D and G bands in the Raman spectra. However, even heat-treatment at a high temperature of 2400 °C could not facilitate a graphitic structure, implying that PP is intrinsically non-graphitizable. Finally, we used mask-derived carbon as an anode material of sodium ion batteries.

As the cost of extracting Li from brine is typically 30–50% lower than conventional hard-rock sources, this work intends to critically analyze the evolution of direct lithium extraction (DLE) methods employed in Salt Lake brine with various magnesium/lithium (Mg/Li) mass ratios whereas the lithium brine concentration (LBC) methods seek to concentrate the Li brine and eliminate contaminants without isolating the Li from the brine. Solvent extraction, precipitation, adsorption, membrane technology, and electrochemical extraction are the developed methods for Li extraction from Salt Lake brine. This review focuses on the mechanism, workflow, and comparative analysis of different methods. Moreover, recent technological advancements to handle the high Mg/Li ratio, such as modification of adsorption using ion sieves, liquid-membrane electrodialysis, and efficient multicomponent doping electrode materials, have also been discussed in depth. Although it was previously believed that solvent extraction was only feasible for low Mg/Li ratio brines, it has recently been commercially applied for high Mg/Li ratio brines in China. Precipitation is more ecology-friendly and economically favorable because of its low cost. Li extraction from brines with high Mg/Li ratios also shows promising performance using aluminate (Al) precipitants and novel Mg precipitants. However, during Mg precipitation, there is a significant loss of Li. On the other hand, in the cost-effective adsorption method, aluminium salt adsorbents are industrially used, yet low adsorption capacities limit their application. Recently, ion-exchange methods have gained popularity, as ‘Li sieves’ exhibit remarkable selectivity and adsorption towards Li-ions and are effective at high Mg/Li ratios. Powdered ionic sieves have low fluidity and solution permeability despite their strong affinity and adsorption capacity. Membrane technology is promising because of the benefits of improved energy consumption, simple controls, high separation rates, and the continuity of the process, yet as an emerging technology, its commercial viability is not proven. Nevertheless, a coupled “adsorption-membrane” technique has been developed and used in China for Salt Lake brines with low Li grades. Furthermore, exceptional selectivity, low energy demand, and minimal impact on the environment of electrochemical methods make Li extraction from brine promising. Being a recent technology, there is ample scope for improving electrode materials and understanding the process mechanism and cell configuration. Lastly, perspectives on the future Li extraction from brines are conferred in this article. By combining the methods (i.e., adsorption and ion exchange, membrane technology, and electrochemical process), the growth potential exists for an efficient, cost-effective, green, and sustainable extraction technology for Li from Salt Lake brine with a high Mg/Li ratio.",,"{'Battery_Material/Battery_Type': ['Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)'], 'Recycling_Process_Used': ['leaching process'], 'Process_Conditions/Battery_Properties': ['1.5 mol/L H2SO4', '40 °C', '240 min'], 'Recovered_Materials': ['lithium', 'iron', 'nickel', 'cobalt', 'and manganese']}
